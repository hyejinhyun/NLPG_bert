1	Gold is a relatively soft metal, so much so that rings are very rarely made from pure gold metal because they get scratched quickly.	But if you alloy gold, by adding a small percentage of other metals such as silver or copper, you not only change the color of the gold―silver making the gold whiter, and copper making the gold redder―you make the gold harder, much harder.	This changing of the properties of metals by very small additions of other ingredients is what makes the study of metals so fascinating. In the case of gold alloys, you might wonder where the silver atoms go.	The answer is that they sit inside the gold crystal structure, taking the place of a gold atom, and it is this atom substitution inside the crystal lattice of the gold that makes it stronger.	58.83%
2	A female lawyer working for a prestigious New York law firm once accompanied the male CEO of a major client to Latin America to negotiate a complex deal.	Soon after they arrived, the head of the prospective Latin American partner suggested that he and the CEO go off together to discuss business―while his wife and the lawyer go shopping. The lawyer was outraged, assuming this to be an example of Latin American gender bias.	Before voicing her objections, however, she called a colleague back in New York, who told her that he, too, had been excluded from preliminary talks during his last negotiation in that country. The Latin American executive was just looking for a diplomatic way to get her out of the picture as a lawyer, not as a woman.	It was the local practice, the colleague suggested, for lawyers to negotiate only with other lawyers, not with the businesspeople. Had the woman lawyer insisted on participating, she would have spoiled the deal and destroyed her credibility.	36.40%
3	The ancient Greeks sought to improve memory through brain training methods such as memory palaces and the method of loci. At the same time, they and the Egyptians became experts at externalizing information, inventing the modern library, a grand storehouse for externalized knowledge.	We don’t know why these simultaneous explosions of intellectual activity occurred when they did (perhaps daily human experience had hit a certain level of complexity). But the human need to organize our lives, our environment, even our thoughts, remains strong.	This need isn’t simply learned; it is a biological imperative―animals organize their environments instinctively. Most mammals are biologically programmed to put their digestive waste away from where they eat and sleep.	Dogs have been known to collect their toys and put them in baskets; ants carry off dead members of the colony to burial grounds; certain birds and rodents create barriers around their nests in order to more easily detect invaders.	46.17%
4	Imitation seems to be a key to the transmission of valuable practices among nonhumans. The most famous example is that of the macaque monkeys on the island of Koshima in Japan.	In the early 1950s, Imo, a one-year-old female macaque, somehow hit upon the idea of washing her sweet potatoes in a stream before eating them. Soon it was hard to find a Koshima macaque who wasn’t careful to wash off her sweet potato before eating it.	A few years later, Imo introduced another innovation. Researchers on the island occasionally gave the monkeys wheat (in addition to sweet potatoes). But the wheat was given to them on the beach, where it quickly became mixed with sand.	Imo, though, realized that if you threw a handful of wheat and sand into the ocean, the sand would sink and the wheat would float. Again, within a few years most of her fellow macaques were throwing wheat and sand into the sea and obtaining the benefits.	59.27%
5	To rise, a fish must reduce its overall density, and most fish do this with a swim bladder.	A fish fills its bladder with oxygen collected from the surrounding water. As it is filled, the bladder expands. Then, the fish has a greater volume, but its weight is not greatly increased.	This means that its density has been decreasing, so the fish experiences a greater rising force. Finally, when the bladder is fully expanded, the fish is at its maximum volume and is pushed to the surface.	Most fish rise using this method, but not all do. Some species don’t need a swim bladder because they spend all their lives moving along the ocean floor. Other fish float and sink by propelling themselves forward.	43.41%
6	There are things we simply cannot see or hear. Many stars are beyond our gaze, and we can’t see atoms, or even the tiny creatures in puddles of rain water.	We can’t hear sounds that many birds or mice can. But we can still learn about them, asking questions and using instruments that let us see or hear far better than with our eyes or ears alone. 	Just as telescopes let us see further into space, microscopes help us see further into the tiny building blocks of living creatures. In the seventeenth century, Antonie van Leeuwenhoek used his small microscopes to look at blood cells and the hairs on a fly’s legs. 	A century later, more advanced microscopes were allowing naturalists to examine these finer details of anatomy and the wonderful array of tiny life.	45.04%
7	To learn about the nature and location of memory, scientists in the 1940s began their search for memory in the most obvious place: within the cells of our brains― our neurons.	They cut out parts of rats’ brains, trying to make them forget a maze, and found that it didn’t matter what part of the brain they chose; the rats never forgot. In 1950, the researchers gave up, concluding that memory must be somewhere else.	Researchers eventually turned their search for memories to the wiring between neurons rather than within the cells themselves. Each of the hundred billion neurons in our brains is connected to seven thousand other neurons, in a dense web of nerve fibers.	These interconnected webs are intricately involved in our memories. The memory the rats had of the maze was spread throughout their brains. Whenever the scientists cut out a piece, they damaged only a small portion of the involved connections.	31.86%
8	Broad, open­ended questions show your interest in the other person’s situation. They often start with “Tell me,” “how,” “who,” “what,” or “why.” 	They are much more powerful than closed questions that require a simple answer such as “yes” or “no” or a specific piece of information. After the broad question opens the conversation and begins to build rapport, the artful questioner builds on the responses and increases his understanding of the information being transferred.	Our computer salesperson might have a client who says, “I need more control over our order system.” He then builds on that response by asking a question using the most important words in the answer―control and order system.	For instance, he might ask, “What aspects of your order system would you like to have more control over?” or “Could you tell me more about your order system?” When the client responds, he builds his next question around the response to that question, and so on.	41.86%
9	Evolution did not give humans the ability to play soccer. True, it produced legs for kicking and elbows for fouling, but all that this enables us to do is perhaps practice penalty kicks alone.	To get into a game with the strangers we find in the schoolyard on any given afternoon, we not only have to work in concert with ten teammates we may never have met before, we also need to know that the eleven players on the opposing team are playing by the same rules.	Other animals that engage strangers in ritualized aggression do so largely by instinct―puppies throughout the world have the rules for rough­and­tumble play built into their genes.	But human teenagers have no such genes for soccer. They can nevertheless play the game with complete strangers because they have all learned an identical set of ideas about soccer. These ideas are entirely imaginary, but if everyone shares them, we can all play the game.	36.56%
10	The foragers’ secret of success, which protected them from starvation and malnutrition, was their varied diet. Farmers tend to eat a very limited and unbalanced diet.	Especially in pre­modern times, most of the calories feeding an agricultural population came from a single crop―such as wheat, potatoes, or rice―that lacks some of the vitamins, minerals, and other nutritional materials humans need.	The typical peasant in traditional China ate rice for breakfast, rice for lunch, and rice for dinner. If she was lucky, she could expect to eat the same on the following day. By contrast, ancient foragers regularly ate dozens of different foodstuffs.	The peasant’s ancient ancestor, the forager, may have eaten berries and mushrooms for breakfast; fruits and snails for lunch; and rabbit steak with wild onions for dinner. Tomorrow’s menu might have been completely different. This variety ensured that the ancient foragers received all the necessary nutrients.	33.40%
11	Psychologists Dember and Earl suggested that the motivation for exploration had its roots in a curiosity drive.	They suggested that curiosity is stimulated by novelty and argued that novelty is in the eye of the beholder. We could have seen something many times before, but as the result of having new skills or competence, we discover new or different aspects of that object.	This is very important for understanding why people will often return to explore things that they explored before or do things they have done before. In our daily lives, for example, we might decide to listen to a piece of music that we have listened to many times.	By returning to that music with a new or fresh perspective, perhaps as a result of listening to other music, we find something new and interesting. One reason that people can play a card game such as bridge over and over is that no matter how many times you have played the game, it will be different in some way.	70.45%
12	The hunters, armed only with primitive weapons, were no real match for an angry mammoth. Many were probably killed or severely injured in the close encounters that were necessary to slay one of these gigantic animals.	But the rewards were great when one was brought down. A single mammoth could feed, clothe, and supply a band for a long time. The hunters had followed the mammoths and other large animals eastward from Asia across what is now the Bering Sea.	Some of them may have traveled by small boat along the coast, but many walked. Twenty thousand years ago, at the height of the last glacial period, sea level was so low that dry land joined what are now separate continents.	Slowly, imperceptibly, and probably unconsciously, hunters had moved across the land bridge and become the first immigrants to the new land. Without the ice age, North America might have remained unpopulated for thousands of years more.	54.83%
13	Frank Barrett, an organizational behavior expert, explains that disrupting routines and looking at a situation from another’s perspective can lead to new solutions.	In a lecture, Barrett shares the story of an airline that was dealing with many complaints about their customer service. The airline’s leaders held a workshop to focus on how to create a better experience for their customers.	While everyone else was in meetings on the first day of the workshop, the airline’s vice president of marketing had the beds in each leader’s hotel room replaced with airline seats.	After having spent that night in airline seats, the company’s leaders came up with some “radical innovations.” If he had not disrupted their sleeping routines and allowed them to experience their customers’ discomfort, the workshop may have ended without any noteworthy changes.	54.46%
14	One of the most notable examples of the collaboration of film director and composer was that of Eisenstein and Prokofiev in the making of Alexander Nevsky (1938).	In the book Film Sense, Eisenstein describes how closely composer and director worked to achieve a structural harmony between picture and sound. First there were lengthy discussions about the intention and construction of each film section.	Following these talks, the composer would sometimes rough out and record musical passages for a scene or sequence. The director would then film these sections and try editing them in accordance with the musical construction.	At other times, a reverse procedure would be followed. Music would be written after a sequence had been shot and edited, to conform to a rough of the final picture “cut.” The aim was to relate music and picture through an identical fluidity of aural and visual structure.	53.67%
15	There was once a king who was unhappy at being overweight, so he called the wisest man in the kingdom to help him to get into shape.	The wise man told him that there was a magic mirror in the king’s woods and, if one looked into it, one would become as thin as one wanted. The only problem was that this mirror could only be found in the woods early in the morning at sunrise and then only for a few minutes did its magic work.	The king then proceeded to get up just before dawn every morning and run around the woods searching for this mirror. After a couple of months the wise man placed a mirror in the woods for the king to find one morning and miraculously he had lost all the weight he had wanted.	Of course the mirror was not magic. The king’s weight loss was directly attributable to two months of early morning jogging. Would the king have taken the advice if he had been told to do that?	60.13%
16	Interestingly, being observed has two quite distinct effects on performance. In some cases, performance is decreased, even to the point of non-existence. The extreme of this is stage fright, the sudden fear of public performance.	There are many instances of well-known actors who, in mid-career, develop stage fright and simply cannot perform. The other extreme is that being observed enhances performance, people doing whatever it might be better when they know that others are watching.	The general rule seems to be that if one is doing something new or for the first time, then being observed while doing it decreases performance. On the other hand, being observed while doing some task or engaging in some activity that is well known or well practiced tends to enhance performance.	So, if you are learning to play a new sport, it is better to begin it alone, but when you become skilled at it, then you will probably perform better with an audience.	49.40%
17	"Evolution works to maximize the number of descendants that an animal leaves behind. Where the risk of death from fishing increases as an animal grows, evolution favors those that grow slowly, mature younger and smaller, and
reproduce earlier."	This is exactly what we now see in the wild. Cod in Canada’s Gulf of St. Lawrence begin to reproduce at around four today; forty years ago they had to wait until six or seven to reach maturity. Sole in the North Sea mature at half the body weight they did in 1950.	Surely these adaptations are good news for species hard-pressed by excessive fishing? Not exactly. Young fish produce many fewer eggs than large-bodied animals, and many industrial fisheries are now so intensive that few animals survive more than a couple of years beyond the age of maturity.	Together this means there are fewer eggs and larvae to secure future generations. In some cases the amount of young produced today is a hundred or even a thousand times less than in the past, putting the survival of species, and the fisheries dependent on them, at grave risk.	40.28%
18	When you look at a map, you may conclude―as commercial airline navigators once did―that the best way to get from Amsterdam to Tokyo is to head in an easterly direction along what is known as the Mediterranean route.	But look at a globe instead of a map, and your perspective may change. Rather than heading east on the Mediterranean route, commercial planes going from Amsterdam to Tokyo now fly north! That’s right.	They take what is known as the ‘polar route,’ flying over the North Pole to Alaska, and then west to Tokyo―for a savings of roughly 1,500 miles! What is the lesson here?	After you’ve decided on a goal, work hard to   accomplish it, but keep looking for ways of achieving the goal more efficiently, perhaps from a different angle. This approach is sometimes known as reframing.	48.38%
19	Why does garbage exist in the human system but not more broadly in nature?	Nature is a beautiful harmony of systems whereby every system’s output is a useful input for other systems. An acorn that falls from a tree is an important input for a squirrel that eats it. The by-product of that delicious meal―the squirrel’s poop―is an important input for the microbes that consume it.	The output of the microbes―rich humus and soil―is in turn the very material from which a new oak tree may grow. Even the carbon dioxide that the squirrel breathes out is what that tree may breathe in.	This cycle is the fundamental reason why life has thrived on our planet for millions of years. It’s like the Ouroboros―the ancient symbol depicting a snake or dragon eating its own tail; in a way, nature truly is a constant cycle of consuming itself.	51.66%
20	Twins provide a unique opportunity to study genes. Some pairs of twins are identical: they share the exact same genes in their DNA.	Other pairs are fraternal, sharing only half of their  genes on average. Differences in genetic similarity turn out to be a powerful natural experiment, allowing us to estimate how much genes influence a given trait.	For example, identical twins almost always have the same eye color, but fraternal twins often do not.This suggests that genes play a role in eye color, and in fact geneticists have identified several specific genes that are involved.	In the same way, scientists can estimate the role genes play in any other trait by comparing the similarity of identical twins to the similarity of fraternal twins. If there is a difference, then the magnitude of the difference gives a clue as to how much genes are involved.	31.87%
21	For years business leaders and politicians have portrayed environmental protection and jobs as mutually exclusive.	Pollution control, protection of natural areas and endangered species, and limits on use of nonrenewable resources, they claim, will choke the economy and throw people out of work. Ecological economists dispute this claim, however.	Their studies show that only 0.1 percent of all large-scale layoffs in the United States in recent years were due to government regulations. Environmental protection, they argue, not only is necessary for a healthy economic system, but it actually creates jobs and stimulates business.	Recycling, for instance, makes more new jobs than extracting raw materials. This doesn’t necessarily mean that recycled goods are more expensive than those from raw resources. We’re simply substituting labor in the recycling center for energy and huge machines used to extract new materials in remote places.	28.21%
22	James Francis was born in England and emigrated to the United States at age 18. One of his first contributions to water engineering was the invention of the sprinkler system now widely used in buildings for fire protection.	Francis’s design involved a series of perforated pipes running throughout the building. It had two defects: it had to be turned on manually, and it had only one valve.	Once the system was activated by opening the valve, water would flow out everywhere. If the building did not burn down, it would certainly be completely flooded.	Only some years later, when other engineers perfected the kind of sprinkler heads in use nowadays, did the concept become popular. They turned on automatically and were activated only where actually needed.	50.58%
23	The difference between selling and marketing is very simple. Selling focuses mainly on the firm’s desire to sell products for revenue.	Salespeople and other forms of promotion are used to create demand for a firm’s current products. Clearly, the needs of the seller are very strong.	Marketing, however, focuses on the needs of the consumer, ultimately benefiting the seller as well. When a product or service is truly marketed, the needs of the consumer are considered from the very beginning of the new product development process, and the product­service mix is designed to meet the unsatisfied needs of the consuming public.	When a product or service is marketed in the proper manner, very little selling is necessary because the consumer need already exists and the product or service is merely being produced to satisfy the need.	35.05%
24	In negotiation, there often will be issues that you do not care about―but that the other side cares about very much! It is important to identify these issues.	For example, you may not care about whether you start your new job in June or July. But if your potential boss strongly prefers that you start as soon as possible, that’s a valuable piece of information.	Now you are in a position to give her something that she values (at no cost to you) and get something of value in return. For example, you might start a month earlier and receive a larger bonus for doing so.	Similarly, when purchasing my home, I discovered that the seller was very interested in closing the deal as soon as possible. So I agreed to close one month earlier than originally offered, and the seller agreed to a lower price.	32.15%
25	Andrew Carnegie, the great early­ twentieth ­century businessman, once heard his sister complain about her two sons.	They were away at college and rarely responded to her letters. Carnegie told her that if he wrote them he would get an immediate response.	He sent off two warm letters to the boys, and told them that he was happy to send each of them a check for a hundred dollars (a large sum in those days). Then he mailed the letters, but didn’t enclose the checks.	Within days he received warm grateful letters from both boys, who noted at the letters’ end that he had unfortunately forgotten to include the check. If the check had been enclosed, would they have responded so quickly?	40.03%
26	Imagine that you just played “Happy Birthday” on a tuba. Next, you play it on a high-pitched violin. None of the tuba’s sounds are duplicated by the violin. 	Yet, we notice something interesting: The melody is still recognizable―as long as the relationship between notes remains the same. Now, what would happen if you played the notes of “Happy Birthday” in the correct order, but at a rate of one per hour? What would we have? Nothing!	The separate notes would no longer be a melody. Perceptually, the melody is somehow more than the individual notes that define it. It was observations like these that launched the Gestalt school of thought.	The German word Gestalt means form, pattern, or whole. Gestalt psychologists studied thinking, learning, and perception in whole units, not by analyzing experiences into parts. Their slogan was, “The whole is greater than the sum of its parts.”	44.09%
27	The Earth is a somewhat irregular clock. Some years the length of the day is found to vary by as much as one part in 10 million, or three seconds in a year of 31.5 million seconds. 	In addition, there are also seasonal changes of a few milliseconds per year. In the winter the Earth slows down, and in the summer it speeds up. Think of the Earth as a spinning skater.	During the winter in the northern hemisphere, water evaporates from the ocean and accumulates as ice and snow on the high mountains. This movement of water from the oceans to the mountaintops is similar to the skater’s extending her arms.	So the Earth slows down in winter; by the summer the snow melts and runs back to the seas, and the Earth speeds up again. This effect is not compensated by the opposite effect in the southern hemisphere because most of the land mass is north of the equator.PM	51.88%
28	It takes time to develop and launch products. Consequently, many companies know 6?12 months ahead of time that they will be launching a new product.	In order to create interest in the product, companies will often launch pre-market advertising campaigns. In the nutrition industry, articles are often written discussing a new nutrient under investigation.	Over a series of issues, you begin to see more articles discussing this new nutrient and potential to enhance training and/or performance. Then, after 4?6 months, a new product is coincidentally launched that contains the ingredient that has been discussed in previous issues. Books and supplement reviews have also been used as vehicles to promote the sale of fitness and nutrition products.	This marketing technique is called demand creation. It involves creating a buzz about a new potentially revolutionary nutrient or training technique through publishing articles and/or books that stimulate the reader’s interest. Once this is done, a new product is launched.	45.88%
29	There’s a direct counterpart to pop music in the classical song, more commonly called an “art song,” which does not focus on the development of melodic material.	Both the pop song and the art song tend to follow tried-and-true structural patterns. And both will be published in the same way―with a vocal line and a basic piano part written out underneath.	But the pop song will rarely be sung and played exactly as written; the singer is apt to embellish that vocal line to give it a “styling,” just as the accompanist will fill out the piano part to make it more interesting and personal. The performers might change the original tempo and mood completely.	You won’t find such extremes of approach by the performers of songs by Franz Schubert or Richard Strauss. These will be performed note for note because both the vocal and piano parts have been painstakingly written down by the composer with an ear for how each relates to the other.	47.95%
30	Suppose that the price of frozen yogurt falls. The law of demand says that you will buy more frozen yogurt. At the same time, you will probably buy less ice cream.	This is because ice cream and frozen yogurt are both cold and sweet desserts, satisfying similar desires. When a fall in the price of one good reduces the demand for another good, the two goods are called substitutes.	They are often pairs of goods that are used in place of each other, like hot dogs and hamburgers. Now suppose that the price of chocolate topping falls. According to the law of demand, you will buy more chocolate topping.	Yet, in this case, you will likely buy more ice cream as well, since ice cream and topping are often used together. When a fall in the price of one good raises the demand for another good, the two goods are called complements.	45.42%
31	Most habits are probably good when they are first formed. That is, for many of the habits that you do not create intentionally, there must have been some value to performing that particular behavior.	That value is what causes you to repeat the behavior often enough to create the habit. Some habits become bad, because a behavior that has rewarding elements to it at one time also has negative consequences that may not have been obvious when the habit began.	Overeating is one such habit. You may know conceptually that eating too much is a problem. But when you actually overeat, there are few really negative consequences in the moment.	So you do it again and again. Eventually, though, you’ll start to gain weight. By the time you really notice this, your habit of eating too much is deeply rooted.	57.47%
32	In early 19th century London, a young man named Charles Dickens had a strong desire to be a writer. But everything seemed to be against him.	He had never been able to attend school for more than four years. His father had been in jail because he couldn’t pay his debts, and this young man often knew the pain of hunger.	Moreover, he had so little confidence in his ability to write that he mailed his writings secretly at night to editors so that nobody would laugh at him. Story after story was refused.	But one day, one editor recognized and praised him. The praise that he received from getting one story in print changed his whole life. His works have been widely read and still enjoy great popularity.	54.49%
33	It is possible to measure how far away from us each galaxy is. How? How, for that matter, do we know how far away anything in the universe is? For nearby stars the best method uses something called ‘parallax’.	Hold your finger up in front of your face and look at it with your left eye closed. Now open your left eye and close your right. Keep switching eyes, and you’ll notice that the apparent position of your finger hops from side to side.	That is because of the difference between the viewpoints of your two eyes. Move your finger nearer, and the hops will become greater. Move your finger farther away and the hops become smaller.	All you need to know is how far apart your eyes are, and you can calculate the distance from eyes to finger by the size of the hops. That is the parallax method of estimating distances.	59.20%
34	Use a plastic pen and rub it on your hair about ten times and then hold the pen close to small pieces of tissue paper or chalk dust.	You will find that the bits of paper or chalk dust cling to the pen. What you have done there is to create a form of electricity called static electricity.	This kind of electricity is produced by friction, and the pen becomes electrically charged. Static electricity is also found in the atmosphere.	During a thunderstorm, clouds may become charged  as they rub against each other. The lightning that we often see during a storm is caused by a large flow of electrical charges between charged clouds and the earth.	56.64%
35	From a correlational observation, we conclude that one variable is related to a second variable. But neither behavior could be directly causing the other even though there is a relationship.	The following example will illustrate why it is difficult to make causal statements on the basis of correlational observation. The researchers at the U.S. Army conducted a study of motorcycle accidents, attempting to correlate the number of accidents with other variables such as socioeconomic level and age.	They found the best predictor to be the number of tattoos the rider had. It would be a ridiculous error to conclude that tattoos cause motorcycle accidents or that motorcycle accidents cause tattoos.	Obviously, a third variable is related to both?perhaps preference for risk. A person who is willing to take risks likes to be tattooed and also takes more chances on a motorcycle.	36.70%
36	A researcher in adult education at the University of Toronto, Allen Tough wrote a paper called “The Iceberg of Informal Adult Learning.”Tough formulated a reverse 20/80 rule for adult learning.	Twenty percent of an adult learner’s efforts were formal, organized by an institution. Eighty percent was informal, organized by the learner. He used the metaphor of an iceberg to describe the large portion of learning, informal learning, that remains invisible.	Tough researched the reasons why people chose to learn on their own rather than attend a class. “People seem to want to be in control,”he wrote. “They want to set their own pace and use their own style of learning; they want to keep it flexible.”	People also seem to consider informal learning experiential and social. Lifelong learning organized around one’s interests might be seen as a new form of recreation.	54.22%
37	The online world is an artificial universe?entirely human-made and designed. The design of the underlying system shapes how we appear and what we see of other people.	It determines the structure of conversations and who has access to what information. Architects of physical cities determine the paths people will take and the sights they will see. They affect people’s mood by creating cathedrals that inspire awe and schools that encourage playfulness.	Architects, however, do not control how the residents of those buildings present themselves or see each other?but the designers of virtual spaces do, and they have far greater influence on the social experience of their users.	They determine whether we see each other’s faces or instead know each other only by name. They can reveal the size and makeup of an audience, or provide the impression that one is writing intimately to only a few, even if millions are in fact reading.	37.16%
38	Suppose that you are busy working on a project one day and you have no time to buy lunch. All of a sudden your best friend shows up with your favorite sandwich.	He tells you that he knows you are busy and he wants to help you out by buying you the sandwich. In this case, you are very likely to appreciate your friend’s help.	However, if a stranger shows up with the same sandwich and offers it to you, you won’t appreciate it. Instead, you would be confused. You would likely think “Who are you, and how do you know what kind of sandwich I like to eat?”	The key difference between these two cases is the level of trust. You trust your best friend so much that you won’t worry about him knowing you too well, but you certainly would not give the same level of trust to a stranger.	50.36%
39	Land is always a scarce resource in urban development; high building density, by providing more built­up space on individual sites, can maximize the utilization of the scarce urban land. 	High building density, therefore, helps to reduce the pressure to develop open spaces and releases more land for communal facilities and services to improve the quality of urban living.	However, some people argue that the opposite is also true. In order to achieve high building density, massive high­rise buildings are inevitable, and these massive structures, crammed into small sites, can conversely result in very little open space and a congested cityscape.	This may happen when high­density development is carried out without planning. Therefore, in order to avoid the negative impacts of high density, thorough planning and appropriate density control are essential.	44.45%
40	The scientific study of the physical characteristics of colors can be traced back to Isaac Newton.	One day, he spotted a set of prisms at a big county fair. He took them home and began to experiment with them. In a darkened room he allowed a thin ray of sunlight to fall on a triangular glass prism.	As soon as the white ray hit the prism, it separated into the familiar colors of the rainbow. This finding was not new, as humans had observed the rainbow since the beginning of time.	It was only when Newton placed a second prism in the path of the spectrum that he found something new. The composite colors produced a white beam. Thus he concluded that white light can be produced by combining the spectral colors.	48.58%
41	In classic experiments on stress, people performed tasks that required concentration, like solving puzzles, while being blasted at random intervals with uncomfortably loud sounds.	They started sweating and their heart rates and blood pressure climbed. They struggled to focus and made mistakes. Many got so frustrated that they gave up. Searching for a way to reduce anxiety, researchers gave some of the participants an escape.	"If the noise became too unpleasant, they could press a button and make it stop. Sure enough, the button allowed them to stay calmer, make fewer mistakes, and show less irritation. That’s nothing surprising.
"	But here’s what is: none of the participants actually pressed the button. Stopping the noise didn’t make the difference...knowing they could stop the noise did. The button gave them a sense of control and allowed them to endure the stress.	40.85%
42	Ever since the first scientific opinion polls revealed that most Americans are at best poorly informed about politics, analysts have asked whether citizens are equipped to play the role democracy assigns them.	However, there is something worse than an inadequately informed public, and that’s a misinformed public. It’s one thing when citizens don’t know something, and realize it, which has always been a problem. It’s another thing when citizens don’t know something, but think they know it, which is the new problem.	It’s the difference between ignorance and irrationality. Whatever else one might conclude about self-government, it’s at risk when citizens don’t know what they’re talking about. Our misinformation owes partly to psychological factors, including our tendency to see the world in ways that suit our desires.	Such factors, however, can explain only the misinformation that has always been with us. The sharp rise in misinformation in recent years has a different source: our media. “They are making us dumb,” says one observer. When fact bends to fiction, the predictable result is political distrust and polarization.	42.86%
43	No one likes to think they’re average, least of all below average.	When asked by psychologists, most people rate themselves above average on all manner of measures including intelligence, looks, health, and so on. Self­control is no different: people consistently overestimate their ability to control themselves.	This over­confidence in self­control can lead people to assume they’ll be able to control themselves in situations in which, it turns out, they can’t. This is why trying to stop an unwanted habit can be an extremely frustrating task.	Over the days and weeks from our resolution to change, we start to notice it popping up again and again. The old habit’s well­practiced performance is beating our conscious desire for change into submission.	49.70%
44	Trade will not occur unless both parties want what the other party has to offer. 	This is referred to as the double coincidence of wants. Suppose a farmer wants to trade eggs with a baker for a loaf of bread. If the baker has no need or desire for eggs, then the farmer is out of luck and does not get any bread.	However, if the farmer is enterprising and utilizes his network of village friends, he might discover that the baker is in need of some new cast­iron trivets for cooling his bread, and it just so happens that the blacksmith needs a new lamb’s wool sweater.	Upon further investigation, the farmer discovers that the weaver has been wanting an omelet for the past week. The farmer will then trade the eggs for the sweater, the sweater for the trivets, and the trivets for his fresh­baked loaf of bread.	47.68%
45	Researchers in psychology follow the scientific method to perform studies that help explain and may predict human behavior. This is a much more challenging task than studying snails or sound waves.	It often requires compromises, such as testing behavior within laboratories rather than natural settings, and asking those readily available (such as introduction to psychology students) to participate rather than collecting data from a true cross-section of the population. It often requires great cleverness to conceive of measures that tap into what people are thinking without altering their thinking, called reactivity.	Simply knowing they are being observed may cause people to behave differently (such as more politely!). People may give answers that they feel are more socially desirable than their true feelings.	But for all of these difficulties for psychology, the payoff of the scientific method is that the findings are replicable; that is, if you run the same study again following the same procedures, you will be very likely to get the same results.	44.04%
46	"Who could deny that the human body is a miracle? Imagine: each of us is safely housed within a bundle of blood, bone, and guts nurturing a little glow of life while suspended in a sea of constant change and danger."""	The miracle becomes even more amazing when you consider the long, slow, evolutionary process of give and take that produced the human body. Our bodies developed with nature, within it, as part of it, over time. Ectio	Housing, likewise, originally developed slowly within particular human cultures and in response to specific climates and environments. Each culture around the world crafted a unique style of housing from the fabric of their surroundings.	In other words, traditional housing approaches were specific to the culture, climate, and environment. Consider the igloo, a building using the thermal mass of ice to enclose heat and resist snow, or the ancient Egyptians’ ventilation domes that produced interior cooling amid burning desert heat.	51.66%
47	Adolescence is a stage of development in which teens have superb cognitive abilities and high rates of learning and memory because they are still riding on the heightened synaptic plasticity of childhood.	These abilities give them a distinct advantage over adults, but because they are so primed to learn, they are also extremely vulnerable to learning the wrong things. How does this happen?	It is all because the brain wants rewards and anything that is learned, good or bad, that stimulates the production of dopamine is interpreted by the brain as a reward.	This means a little bit of stimulation to a teenage brain whose synapses are firing all over the place leads to wanting more stimulation that can, in certain situations, result in a kind of overlearning. The more commonly known name for this overlearning is addiction.	58.75%
48	Government goods and services are, by and large, distributed to groups of individuals through the use of nonmarket rationing.	This means that government goods and services are not made available to persons according to their willingness to pay and their use is not rationed by prices. In some cases, the services are available to all, with no direct charge and no eligibility requirements.	The provision of national defense services is one strong example of a good that is freely available to all and not rationed by prices. In other cases, criteria such as income, age, residence, or the payment of certain taxes or charges are used to determine eligibility to receive benefits.	For example, to receive Social Security pensions in the United States, individuals must be of a certain age, have worked for a certain period of time (about 10 years) while covered by Social Security, and must have paid their share of Social Security taxes during that time.	37.30%
49	Why do meteorologists measure temperature in the shade, rather than in the Sun? Aren’t people more interested in the temperature in the Sun? Why don’t they report it?	It turns out that there is a good reason. Thermometers are supposed to measure air temperature. When you place them in a room, they eventually reach the same temperature as the air.	However, if you put a thermometer in direct sunlight, the red­colored alcohol absorbs more sunlight than does the transparent air. That makes the thermometer hotter than the air. Of course, heat will flow from the thermometer into the air, but if the Sun keeps shining on the thermometer, the thermometer will always be hotter.	So a thermometer in the Sun does not measure the air temperature. On the other hand, the temperature of the air in the shade is usually the same as that in the Sun. So if you really want to know the temperature of the sunlit air, measure it in the shade.	48.87%
50	The evolution in the West from the late seventeenth century onwards of the idea of the aesthetic in music produced musical forms which were specifically intended to be listened to by a knowledgeable public and performed only by experts and masters.	That is, specially trained musicians performed and the audience was expected to contemplate the musical aesthetic as they listened. It is from this tradition that the instrumental and vocal forms of modern western music have evolved.	In addition to such events, there was also communal music­making, especially at festivals such as the Winter Solstice, Harvest time, Spring time, and other secular celebrations where everyone participated. Music in the Christian church is similarly organised with communally sung hymns, anthems, and other liturgical items sung by the specially trained choir.	To this extent, it can be claimed that most cultures, if not all of them, have both communal music­making where everyone participates and where the notion of musical talent is irrelevant, and special ritual and ceremonial music where only the specially talented and trained perform, and where the rest listen and participate as observers.	27.27%
