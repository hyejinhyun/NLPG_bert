"Many of these early avialans shared unusual anatomical features that may be ancestral to modern birds, but were later lost during bird evolution.These features include enlarged claws on the second toe which may have been held clear of the ground in life, and long feathers or ""hind wings"" covering the hind limbs and feet, which may have been used in aerial maneuvering."

 	1	The earliest divergence within the Neognathes was that of the Galloanserae, the superorder containing the Anseriformes (ducks, geese, swans and screamers) and the Galliformes (the pheasants, grouse, and their allies, together with the mound builders and the guans and their allies).	The earliest fossil remains of true birds come from the possible galliform Austinornis lentus, dated to about 85 million years ago, but the dates for the actual splits are much debated by scientists.

The Aves are agreed to have evolved in the Cretaceous, and the split between the Galloanseri from other Neognathes occurred before the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event, but there are different opinions about whether the radiation of the remaining Neognathes occurred before or after the extinction of the other dinosaurs.

This disagreement is in part caused by a divergence in the evidence; molecular dating suggests a Cretaceous radiation, while fossil evidence supports a Cenozoic radiation.Attempts to reconcile the molecular and fossil evidence have proved controversial, but recent results show that all the extant groups of birds originated from only a small handful of species that survived the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction.

 	1	Like the reptiles, birds are primarily uricotelic, that is, their kidneys extract nitrogenous waste from their bloodstream and excrete it as uric acid instead of urea or ammonia through the ureters into the intestine.Birds do not have a urinary bladder or external urethral opening and (with exception of the ostrich) uric acid is excreted along with feces as a semisolid waste.However, birds such as hummingbirds can be facultatively ammonotelic, excreting most of the nitrogenous wastes as ammonia.	They also excrete creatine, rather than creatinine like mammals.This material, as well as the output of the intestines, emerges from the bird's cloaca.The cloaca is a multi-purpose opening: waste is expelled through it, most birds mate by joining cloaca, and females lay eggs from it.

When not copulating, it is hidden within the proctodeum compartment within the cloaca, just inside the vent.The digestive system of birds is unique, with a crop for storage and a gizzard that contains swallowed stones for grinding food to compensate for the lack of teeth.Most birds are highly adapted for rapid digestion to aid with flight.Some migratory birds have adapted to use protein from many parts of their bodies, including protein from the intestines, as additional energy during migration.
 	1	Birds have one of the most complex respiratory systems of all animal groups.	Upon inhalation, 75% of the fresh air bypasses the lungs and flows directly into a posterior air sac which extends from the lungs and connects with air spaces in the bones and fills them with air.
 	0	Birds have one of the most complex respiratory systems of all animal groups.	The other 25% of the air goes directly into the lungs.When the bird exhales, the used air flows out of the lung and the stored fresh air from the posterior air sac is simultaneously forced into the lungs.
 	0	Birds have one of the most complex respiratory systems of all animal groups.	Thus, a bird's lungs receive a constant supply of fresh air during both inhalation and exhalation.Sound production is achieved using the syrinx, a muscular chamber incorporating multiple tympanic membranes which diverges from the lower end of the trachea; the trachea being elongated in some species, increasing the volume of vocalizations and the perception of the bird's size.
 	1	The avian circulatory system is driven by a four-chambered, myogenic heart contained in a fibrous pericardial sac.This pericardial sac is filled with a serous fluid for lubrication.	The heart itself is divided into a right and left half, each with an atrium and ventricle.The atrium and ventricles of each side are separated by atrioventricular valves which prevent back flow from one chamber to the next during contraction.Being myogenic, the heart's pace is maintained by pacemaker cells found in the sinoatrial node, located on the right atrium.

Much like a mammalian heart, the avian heart is composed of endocardial, myocardial and epicardial layers.The atrium walls tend to be thinner than the ventricle walls, due to the intense ventricular contraction used to pump oxygenated blood throughout the body.Avian hearts are generally larger than mammalian hearts when compared to body mass.This adaptation allows more blood to be pumped to meet the high metabolic need associated with flight.
 	1	Birds have a very efficient system for diffusing oxygen into the blood; birds have a ten times greater surface area to gas exchange volume than mammals.As a result, birds have more blood in their capillaries per unit of volume of lung than a mammal.The arteries are composed of thick elastic muscles to withstand the pressure of the ventricular constriction, and become more rigid as they move away from the heart.	Blood moves through the arteries, which undergo vasoconstriction, and into arterioles which act as a transportation system to distribute primarily oxygen as well as nutrients to all tissues of the body.As the arterioles move away from the heart and into individual organs and tissues they are further divided to increase surface area and slow blood flow.Travelling through the arterioles blood moves into the capillaries where gas exchange can occur.

Capillaries are organized into capillary beds in tissues, it is here that blood exchanges oxygen for carbon dioxide waste.In the capillary beds blood flow is slowed to allow maximum diffusion of oxygen into the tissues.Once the blood has become deoxygenated it travels through venules then veins and back to the heart.

Veins, unlike arteries, are thin and rigid as they do not need to withstand extreme pressure.As blood travels through the venules to the veins a funneling occurs called vasodilation bringing blood back to the heart.Once the blood reaches the heart it moves first into the right atrium, then the right ventricle to be pumped through the lungs for further gas exchange of carbon dioxide waste for oxygen.Oxygenated blood then flows from the lungs through the left atrium to the left ventricle where it is pumped out to the body.

Ultraviolet light is also used in foraging—kestrels have been shown to search for prey by detecting the UV reflective urine trail marks left on the ground by rodents.The eyelids of a bird are not used in blinking.Instead the eye is lubricated by the nictitating membrane, a third eyelid that moves horizontally.

 	0	Feathers are a feature characteristic of birds (though also present in some dinosaurs not currently considered to be true birds).	The distribution pattern of these feather tracts (pterylosis) is used in taxonomy and systematics.The arrangement and appearance of feathers on the body, called plumage, may vary within species by age, social status, and sex.
 	1	"Plumage is regularly moulted; the standard plumage of a bird that has moulted after breeding is known as the ""non-breeding"" plumage, or—in the Humphrey-Parkes terminology—""basic"" plumage; breeding plumages or variations of the basic plumage are known under the Humphrey-Parkes system as ""alternate"" plumages.Moulting is annual in most species, although some may have two moults a year, and large birds of prey may moult only once every few years.Moulting patterns vary across species."	In passerines, flight feathers are replaced one at a time with the innermost primary being the first.When the fifth of sixth primary is replaced, the outermost tertiaries begin to drop.After the innermost tertiaries are moulted, the secondaries starting from the innermost begin to drop and this proceeds to the outer feathers (centrifugal moult).

The greater primary coverts are moulted in synchrony with the primary that they overlap.A small number of species, such as ducks and geese, lose all of their flight feathers at once, temporarily becoming flightless.As a general rule, the tail feathers are moulted and replaced starting with the innermost pair.Centripetal moults of tail feathers are however seen in the Phasianidae.

The centrifugal moult is modified in the tail feathers of woodpeckers and treecreepers, in that it begins with the second innermost pair of feathers and finishes with the central pair of feathers so that the bird maintains a functional climbing tail.The general pattern seen in passerines is that the primaries are replaced outward, secondaries inward, and the tail from center outward.Before nesting, the females of most bird species gain a bare brood patch by losing feathers close to the belly.The skin there is well supplied with blood vessels and helps the bird in incubation.
 	1	Most birds can fly, which distinguishes them from almost all other vertebrate classes.	Flight is the primary means of locomotion for most bird species and is used for breeding, feeding, and predator avoidance and escape.Birds have various adaptations for flight, including a lightweight skeleton, two large flight muscles, the pectoralis (which accounts for 15% of the total mass of the bird) and the supracoracoideus, as well as a modified forelimb (wing) that serves as an aerofoil.

 	1	Many bird species migrate to take advantage of global differences of seasonal temperatures, therefore optimising availability of food sources and breeding habitat.These migrations vary among the different groups.	Many landbirds, shorebirds, and waterbirds undertake annual long distance migrations, usually triggered by the length of daylight as well as weather conditions.These birds are characterised by a breeding season spent in the temperate or polar regions and a non-breeding season in the tropical regions or opposite hemisphere.

Seabirds also undertake long migrations, the longest annual migration being those of sooty shearwaters, which nest in New Zealand and Chile and spend the northern summer feeding in the North Pacific off Japan, Alaska and California, an annual round trip of 64,000 km (39,800 mi).Other seabirds disperse after breeding, travelling widely but having no set migration route.Albatrosses nesting in the Southern Ocean often undertake circumpolar trips between breeding seasons.
 	1	Some bird species undertake shorter migrations, travelling only as far as is required to avoid bad weather or obtain food.Irruptive species such as the boreal finches are one such group and can commonly be found at a location in one year and absent the next.	This type of migration is normally associated with food availability.Species may also travel shorter distances over part of their range, with individuals from higher latitudes travelling into the existing range of conspecifics; others undertake partial migrations, where only a fraction of the population, usually females and subdominant males, migrates.

"These displays may signal aggression or submission or may contribute to the formation of pair-bonds.The most elaborate displays occur during courtship, where ""dances"" are often formed from complex combinations of many possible component movements; males' breeding success may depend on the quality of such displays."
 	1	While some birds are essentially territorial or live in small family groups, other birds may form large flocks.	The principal benefits of flocking are safety in numbers and increased foraging efficiency.
 	0	While some birds are essentially territorial or live in small family groups, other birds may form large flocks.	Defence against predators is particularly important in closed habitats like forests, where ambush predation is common and multiple eyes can provide a valuable early warning system.
 	0	While some birds are essentially territorial or live in small family groups, other birds may form large flocks.	This has led to the development of many mixed-species feeding flocks, which are usually composed of small numbers of many species; these flocks provide safety in numbers but increase potential competition for resources.Costs of flocking include bullying of socially subordinate birds by more dominant birds and the reduction of feeding efficiency in certain cases.
 	1	"The high metabolic rates of birds during the active part of the day is supplemented by rest at other times.Sleeping birds often use a type of sleep known as vigilant sleep, where periods of rest are interspersed with quick eye-opening ""peeks"", allowing them to be sensitive to disturbances and enable rapid escape from threats."	Swifts are believed to be able to sleep in flight and radar observations suggest that they orient themselves to face the wind in their roosting flight.It has been suggested that there may be certain kinds of sleep which are possible even when in flight.

This adaptation is also known from marine mammals.Communal roosting is common because it lowers the loss of body heat and decreases the risks associated with predators.Roosting sites are often chosen with regard to thermoregulation and safety.
 	1	Many sleeping birds bend their heads over their backs and tuck their bills in their back feathers, although others place their beaks among their breast feathers.Many birds rest on one leg, while some may pull up their legs into their feathers, especially in cold weather.	Perching birds have a tendon locking mechanism that helps them hold on to the perch when they are asleep.Many ground birds, such as quails and pheasants, roost in trees.

This physiological adaptation shows in nearly a hundred other species, including owlet-nightjars, nightjars, and woodswallows.One species, the common poorwill, even enters a state of hibernation.Birds do not have sweat glands, but they may cool themselves by moving to shade, standing in water, panting, increasing their surface area, fluttering their throat or by using special behaviours like urohidrosis to cool themselves.
 	1	Ninety-five percent of bird species are socially monogamous.These species pair for at least the length of the breeding season or—in some cases—for several years or until the death of one mate.	Monogamy allows for both paternal care and biparental care, which is especially important for species in which females require males' assistance for successful brood-rearing.Among many socially monogamous species, extra-pair copulation (infidelity) is common.

Such behaviour typically occurs between dominant males and females paired with subordinate males, but may also be the result of forced copulation in ducks and other anatids.Female birds have sperm storage mechanisms that allow sperm from males to remain viable long after copulation, a hundred days in some species.
 	0	Ninety-five percent of bird species are socially monogamous.These species pair for at least the length of the breeding season or—in some cases—for several years or until the death of one mate.	Sperm from multiple males may compete through this mechanism.For females, possible benefits of extra-pair copulation include getting better genes for her offspring and insuring against the possibility of infertility in her mate.Males of species that engage in extra-pair copulations will closely guard their mates to ensure the parentage of the offspring that they raise.
 	1	Breeding usually involves some form of courtship display, typically performed by the male.	Most displays are rather simple and involve some type of song.
 	0	Breeding usually involves some form of courtship display, typically performed by the male.	Some displays, however, are quite elaborate.Depending on the species, these may include wing or tail drumming, dancing, aerial flights, or communal lekking.
 	0	Breeding usually involves some form of courtship display, typically performed by the male.	Females are generally the ones that drive partner selection, although in the polyandrous phalaropes, this is reversed: plainer males choose brightly coloured females.Courtship feeding, billing and allopreening are commonly performed between partners, generally after the birds have paired and mated.
 	1	All birds lay amniotic eggs with hard shells made mostly of calcium carbonate.	Hole and burrow nesting species tend to lay white or pale eggs, while open nesters lay camouflaged eggs.
 	0	All birds lay amniotic eggs with hard shells made mostly of calcium carbonate.	There are many exceptions to this pattern, however; the ground-nesting nightjars have pale eggs, and camouflage is instead provided by their plumage.
 	0	All birds lay amniotic eggs with hard shells made mostly of calcium carbonate.	Species that are victims of brood parasites have varying egg colours to improve the chances of spotting a parasite's egg, which forces female parasites to match their eggs to those of their hosts.
 	1	Bird eggs are usually laid in a nest.	Most species create somewhat elaborate nests, which can be cups, domes, plates, beds scrapes, mounds, or burrows.Some bird nests, however, are extremely primitive; albatross nests are no more than a scrape on the ground.
 	0	Bird eggs are usually laid in a nest.	Most birds build nests in sheltered, hidden areas to avoid predation, but large or colonial birds—which are more capable of defence—may build more open nests.
 	0	Bird eggs are usually laid in a nest.	During nest construction, some species seek out plant matter from plants with parasite-reducing toxins to improve chick survival, and feathers are often used for nest insulation.Some bird species have no nests; the cliff-nesting common guillemot lays its eggs on bare rock, and male emperor penguins keep eggs between their body and feet.The absence of nests is especially prevalent in ground-nesting species where the newly hatched young are precocial.
 	1	Incubation, which optimises temperature for chick development, usually begins after the last egg has been laid.	In monogamous species incubation duties are often shared, whereas in polygamous species one parent is wholly responsible for incubation.
 	0	Incubation, which optimises temperature for chick development, usually begins after the last egg has been laid.	Warmth from parents passes to the eggs through brood patches, areas of bare skin on the abdomen or breast of the incubating birds.Incubation can be an energetically demanding process; adult albatrosses, for instance, lose as much as 83 grams (2.9 oz) of body weight per day of incubation.
 	0	Incubation, which optimises temperature for chick development, usually begins after the last egg has been laid.	The warmth for the incubation of the eggs of megapodes comes from the sun, decaying vegetation or volcanic sources.Incubation periods range from 10 days (in woodpeckers, cuckoos and passerine birds) to over 80 days (in albatrosses and kiwis).
 	1	The length and nature of parental care varies widely amongst different orders and species.	At one extreme, parental care in megapodes ends at hatching; the newly hatched chick digs itself out of the nest mound without parental assistance and can fend for itself immediately.
 	0	The length and nature of parental care varies widely amongst different orders and species.	At the other extreme, many seabirds have extended periods of parental care, the longest being that of the great frigatebird, whose chicks take up to six months to fledge and are fed by the parents for up to an additional 14 months.
 	0	The length and nature of parental care varies widely amongst different orders and species.	The chick guard stage describes the period of breeding during which one of the adult birds is permanently present at the nest after chicks have hatched.The main purpose of the guard stage is to aid offspring to thermoregulate and protect them from predation.
 	1	In some species, both parents care for nestlings and fledglings; in others, such care is the responsibility of only one sex.	In some species, other members of the same species—usually close relatives of the breeding pair, such as offspring from previous broods—will help with the raising of the young.
 	0	In some species, both parents care for nestlings and fledglings; in others, such care is the responsibility of only one sex.	Such alloparenting is particularly common among the Corvida, which includes such birds as the true crows, Australian magpie and fairy-wrens, but has been observed in species as different as the rifleman and red kite.Among most groups of animals, male parental care is rare.
 	0	In some species, both parents care for nestlings and fledglings; in others, such care is the responsibility of only one sex.	In birds, however, it is quite common—more so than in any other vertebrate class.Though territory and nest site defence, incubation, and chick feeding are often shared tasks, there is sometimes a division of labour in which one mate undertakes all or most of a particular duty.
 	1	The point at which chicks fledge varies dramatically.	The chicks of the Synthliboramphus murrelets, like the ancient murrelet, leave the nest the night after they hatch, following their parents out to sea, where they are raised away from terrestrial predators.
 	0	The point at which chicks fledge varies dramatically.	Some other species, such as ducks, move their chicks away from the nest at an early age.In most species, chicks leave the nest just before, or soon after, they are able to fly.
 	0	The point at which chicks fledge varies dramatically.	The amount of parental care after fledging varies; albatross chicks leave the nest on their own and receive no further help, while other species continue some supplementary feeding after fledging.Chicks may also follow their parents during their first migration.
 	1	Brood parasitism, in which an egg-layer leaves her eggs with another individual's brood, is more common among birds than any other type of organism.	After a parasitic bird lays her eggs in another bird's nest, they are often accepted and raised by the host at the expense of the host's own brood.
 	0	Brood parasitism, in which an egg-layer leaves her eggs with another individual's brood, is more common among birds than any other type of organism.	Brood parasites may be either obligate brood parasites, which must lay their eggs in the nests of other species because they are incapable of raising their own young, or non-obligate brood parasites, which sometimes lay eggs in the nests of conspecifics to increase their reproductive output even though they could have raised their own young.
 	0	Brood parasitism, in which an egg-layer leaves her eggs with another individual's brood, is more common among birds than any other type of organism.	One hundred bird species, including honeyguides, icterids, and ducks, are obligate parasites, though the most famous are the cuckoos.Some brood parasites are adapted to hatch before their host's young, which allows them to destroy the host's eggs by pushing them out of the nest or to kill the host's chicks; this ensures that all food brought to the nest will be fed to the parasitic chicks.
 	1	Birds have evolved a variety of mating behaviors, with the peacock tail being perhaps the most famous example of sexual selection and the Fisherian runaway.	Commonly occurring sexual dimorphisms such as size and color differences are energetically costly attributes that signal competitive breeding situations.
 	0	Birds have evolved a variety of mating behaviors, with the peacock tail being perhaps the most famous example of sexual selection and the Fisherian runaway.	Many types of avian sexual selection have been identified; intersexual selection, also known as female choice; and intrasexual competition, where individuals of the more abundant sex compete with each other for the privilege to mate.Sexually selected traits often evolve to become more pronounced in competitive breeding situations until the trait begins to limit the individual’s fitness.
 	0	Birds have evolved a variety of mating behaviors, with the peacock tail being perhaps the most famous example of sexual selection and the Fisherian runaway.	"Conflicts between an individual fitness and signaling adaptations ensure that sexually selected ornaments such as plumage coloration and courtship behavior are ""honest"" traits.Signals must be costly to ensure that only good-quality individuals can present these exaggerated sexual ornaments and behaviors."
 	1	Incestuous matings by the purple-crowned fairy wren Malurus coronatus result in severe fitness costs due to inbreeding depression (greater than 30% reduction in hatchability of eggs).	Females paired with related males may undertake extra pair matings (see Promiscuity#Other animals for 90% frequency in avian species) that can reduce the negative effects of inbreeding.

 	1	Cooperative breeding in birds typically occurs when offspring, usually males, delay dispersal from their natal group in order to remain with the family to help rear younger kin.	Female offspring rarely stay at home, dispersing over distances that allow them to breed independently, or to join unrelated groups.
 	0	Cooperative breeding in birds typically occurs when offspring, usually males, delay dispersal from their natal group in order to remain with the family to help rear younger kin.	In general, inbreeding is avoided because it leads to a reduction in progeny fitness (inbreeding depression) due largely to the homozygous expression of deleterious recessive alleles.
 	0	Cooperative breeding in birds typically occurs when offspring, usually males, delay dispersal from their natal group in order to remain with the family to help rear younger kin.	Cross-fertilization between unrelated individuals ordinarily leads to the masking of deleterious recessive alleles in progeny.
 	1	Birds occupy a wide range of ecological positions.	While some birds are generalists, others are highly specialised in their habitat or food requirements.Even within a single habitat, such as a forest, the niches occupied by different species of birds vary, with some species feeding in the forest canopy, others beneath the canopy, and still others on the forest floor.
 	0	Birds occupy a wide range of ecological positions.	Forest birds may be insectivores, frugivores, and nectarivores.
 	0	Birds occupy a wide range of ecological positions.	Aquatic birds generally feed by fishing, plant eating, and piracy or kleptoparasitism.Birds of prey specialise in hunting mammals or other birds, while vultures are specialised scavengers.Avivores are animals that are specialized at preying on birds.

 	0	Birds are often important to island ecology.	Today the plants of New Zealand retain the defensive adaptations evolved to protect them from the extinct moa.Nesting seabirds may also affect the ecology of islands and surrounding seas, principally through the concentration of large quantities of guano, which may enrich the local soil and the surrounding seas.

"Due to a revolt by Han in Liaodong in 1623, Nurhachi, who previously gave concessions to conquered Han subjects in Liaodong, turned against them and ordered that they no longer be trusted; He enacted discriminatory policies and killings against them, while ordering that Han who assimilated to the Jurchen (in Jilin) before 1619 be treated equally as Jurchens were and not like the conquered Han in Liaodong.Hong Taiji instead incorporated them into the Jurchen ""nation"" as full (if not first-class) citizens, obligated to provide military service."

By 1648, less than one-sixth of the bannermen were of Manchu ancestry.This change of policy not only increased Hong Taiji's manpower and reduced his military dependence on banners not under his personal control, it also greatly encouraged other Han Chinese subjects of the Ming dynasty to surrender and accept Jurchen rule when they were defeated militarily.Through these and other measures Hong Taiji was able to centralize power unto the office of the Khan, which in the long run prevented the Jurchen federation from fragmenting after his death.

The examination system offered a path for ethnic Han to become officials.Imperial patronage of Kangxi Dictionary demonstrated respect for Confucian learning, while the Sacred Edict of 1670 effectively extolled Confucian family values.The second major source of stability was the Central Asian aspect of their Manchu identity which allowed them to appeal to Mongol, Tibetan and Uighur constituents.

At the peak of the rebels' fortunes, they extended their control as far north as the Yangtze River, nearly establishing a divided China.Wu then hesitated to go further north, not being able to coordinate strategy with his allies, and Kangxi was able to unify his forces for a counterattack led by a new generation of Manchu generals.By 1681, the Qing government had established control over a ravaged southern China which took several decades to recover.Manchu Generals and Bannermen were initially put to shame by the better performance of the Han Chinese Green Standard Army, who fought better than them against the rebels and this was noted by Kangxi, leading him to task Generals Sun Sike, Wang Jinbao, and Zhao Liangdong to lead Green Standard Soldiers to crush the rebels.

The Qing thought that Han Chinese were superior at battling other Han people and so used the Green Standard Army as the dominant and majority army in crushing the rebels instead of Bannermen.Similarly, in northwestern China against Wang Fuchen, the Qing used Han Chinese Green Standard Army soldiers and Han Chinese Generals such as Zhang Liangdong, Wang Jinbao, and Zhang Yong as the primary military forces.This choice was due to the rocky terrain, which favoured infantry troops over cavalry, to the desire to keep Bannermen in the reserves, and, again, to the belief that Han troops were better at fighting other Han people.

 	0	Literature grew to new heights in the Qing period.	The poetry of the Qing dynasty is a lively field of research, being studied (along with the poetry of the Ming dynasty) for its association with Chinese opera, developmental trends of Classical Chinese poetry, the transition to a greater role for vernacular language, and for poetry by women in Chinese culture.The Qing dynasty was a period of much literary collection and criticism, and many of the modern popular versions of Classical Chinese poems were transmitted through Qing dynasty anthologies, such as the Quantangshi and the Three Hundred Tang Poems.
 	0	Literature grew to new heights in the Qing period.	Pu Songling brought the short story form to a new level in his Strange Stories from a Chinese Studio, published in the mid-18th century, and Shen Fu demonstrated the charm of the informal memoir in Six Chapters of a Floating Life, written in the early 19th century but published only in 1877.The art of the novel reached a pinnacle in Cao Xueqin's Dream of the Red Chamber, but its combination of social commentary and psychological insight were echoed in highly skilled novels such as Wu Jingzi's The Scholars (1750) and Li Ruzhen's Flowers in the Mirror (1827).

As universities increasingly came under state control, or formed under the auspices of the state, the faculty governance model (begun by the University of Paris) became more and more prominent.Although the older student-controlled universities still existed, they slowly started to move toward this structural organization.Control of universities still tended to be independent, although university leadership was increasingly appointed by the state.

 	1	Early Modern universities initially continued the curriculum and research of the Middle Ages: natural philosophy, logic, medicine, theology, mathematics, astronomy (and astrology), law, grammar and rhetoric.Aristotle was prevalent throughout the curriculum, while medicine also depended on Galen and Arabic scholarship.The importance of humanism for changing this state-of-affairs cannot be underestimated.	Once humanist professors joined the university faculty, they began to transform the study of grammar and rhetoric through the studia humanitatis.Humanist professors focused on the ability of students to write and speak with distinction, to translate and interpret classical texts, and to live honorable lives.Other scholars within the university were affected by the humanist approaches to learning and their linguistic expertise in relation to ancient texts, as well as the ideology that advocated the ultimate importance of those texts.

In law, Andreas Alciatus infused the Corpus Juris with a humanist perspective, while Jacques Cujas humanist writings were paramount to his reputation as a jurist.Philipp Melanchthon cited the works of Erasmus as a highly influential guide for connecting theology back to original texts, which was important for the reform at Protestant universities.Galileo Galilei, who taught at the Universities of Pisa and Padua, and Martin Luther, who taught at the University of Wittenberg (as did Melanchthon), also had humanist training.The task of the humanists was to slowly permeate the university; to increase the humanist presence in professorships and chairs, syllabi and textbooks so that published works would demonstrate the humanistic ideal of science and scholarship.

It was the case that the academic foundations remaining from the Middle Ages were stable, and they did provide for an environment that fostered considerable growth and development.There was considerable reluctance on the part of universities to relinquish the symmetry and comprehensiveness provided by the Aristotelian system, which was effective as a coherent system for understanding and interpreting the world.

Another example was the short-lived but fairly rapid adoption of Cartesian epistemology and methodology in European universities, and the debates surrounding that adoption, which led to more mechanistic approaches to scientific problems as well as demonstrated an openness to change.There are many examples which belie the commonly perceived intransigence of universities.Although universities may have been slow to accept new sciences and methodologies as they emerged, when they did accept new ideas it helped to convey legitimacy and respectability, and supported the scientific changes through providing a stable environment for instruction and material resources.

In his Fasti, a long-form poem covering Roman holidays from January to June, Ovid presents a unique look at Roman antiquarian lore, popular customs, and religious practice that is by turns imaginative, entertaining, high-minded, and scurrilous; not a priestly account, despite the speaker's pose as a vates or inspired poet-prophet, but a work of description, imagination and poetic etymology that reflects the broad humor and burlesque spirit of such venerable festivals as the Saturnalia, Consualia, and feast of Anna Perenna on the Ides of March, where Ovid treats the assassination of the newly deified Julius Caesar as utterly incidental to the festivities among the Roman people.

Any of these moral deviations could cause divine anger (ira deorum) and therefore harm the State.The official deities of the state were identified with its lawful offices and institutions, and Romans of every class were expected to honour the beneficence and protection of mortal and divine superiors.Participation in public rites showed a personal commitment to their community and its values.

By the late Republican era, the flamines were supervised by the pontifical collegia.The rex sacrorum had become a relatively obscure priesthood with an entirely symbolic title: his religious duties still included the daily, ritual announcement of festivals and priestly duties within two or three of the latter but his most important priestly role – the supervision of the Vestals and their rites – fell to the more politically powerful and influential pontifex maximus.
 	1	Public priests were appointed by the collegia.Once elected, a priest held permanent religious authority from the eternal divine, which offered him lifetime influence, privilege and immunity.Therefore, civil and religious law limited the number and kind of religious offices allowed an individual and his family.	Religious law was collegial and traditional; it informed political decisions, could overturn them, and was difficult to exploit for personal gain.Priesthood was a costly honour: in traditional Roman practice, a priest drew no stipend.Cult donations were the property of the deity, whose priest must provide cult regardless of shortfalls in public funding – this could mean subsidy of acolytes and all other cult maintenance from personal funds.

In Rome, the same Imperial cult role was performed by the Arval Brethren, once an obscure Republican priesthood dedicated to several deities, then co-opted by Augustus as part of his religious reforms.The Arvals offered prayer and sacrifice to Roman state gods at various temples for the continued welfare of the Imperial family on their birthdays, accession anniversaries and to mark extraordinary events such as the quashing of conspiracy or revolt.Every January 3 they consecrated the annual vows and rendered any sacrifice promised in the previous year, provided the gods had kept the Imperial family safe for the contracted time.

Rome itself was an intrinsically sacred space; its ancient boundary (pomerium) had been marked by Romulus himself with oxen and plough; what lay within was the earthly home and protectorate of the gods of the state.In Rome, the central references for the establishment of an augural templum appear to have been the Via Sacra (Sacred Way) and the pomerium.

Magistrates sought divine opinion of proposed official acts through an augur, who read the divine will through observations made within the templum before, during and after an act of sacrifice.Divine disapproval could arise through unfit sacrifice, errant rites (vitium) or an unacceptable plan of action.If an unfavourable sign was given, the magistrate could repeat the sacrifice until favourable signs were seen, consult with his augural colleagues, or abandon the project.

Magistrates could use their right of augury (ius augurum) to adjourn and overturn the process of law, but were obliged to base their decision on the augur's observations and advice.For Cicero, himself an augur, this made the augur the most powerful authority in the Late Republic.By his time (mid 1st century BC) augury was supervised by the college of pontifices, whose powers were increasingly woven into the magistracies of the cursus honorum.

"The major prodigies included the spontaneous combustion of weapons, the apparent shrinking of the sun's disc, two moons in a daylit sky, a cosmic battle between sun and moon, a rain of red-hot stones, a bloody sweat on statues, and blood in fountains and on ears of corn: all were expiated by sacrifice of ""greater victims""."

 	0	Roman beliefs about an afterlife varied, and are known mostly for the educated elite who expressed their views in terms of their chosen philosophy.	As Roman society developed, its Republican nobility tended to invest less in spectacular funerals and extravagant housing for their dead, and more on monumental endowments to the community, such as the donation of a temple or public building whose donor was commemorated by his statue and inscribed name.Persons of low or negligible status might receive simple burial, with such grave goods as relatives could afford.

"Tombs were shared by Christian and non-Christian family members, and the traditional funeral rites and feast of novemdialis found a part-match in the Christian Constitutio Apostolica.The customary offers of wine and food to the dead continued; St Augustine (following St Ambrose) feared that this invited the ""drunken"" practices of Parentalia but commended funeral feasts as a Christian opportunity to give alms of food to the poor."

The most important camp-offering appears to have been the suovetaurilia performed before a major, set battle.A ram, a boar and a bull were ritually garlanded, led around the outer perimeter of the camp (a lustratio exercitus) and in through a gate, then sacrificed: Trajan's column shows three such events from his Dacian wars.The perimeter procession and sacrifice suggest the entire camp as a divine templum; all within are purified and protected.

In the early Republic, as presumably in the regal era, plebeians were excluded from high religious and civil office, and could be punished for offenses against laws of which they had no knowledge.They resorted to strikes and violence to break the oppressive patrician monopolies of high office, public priesthood, and knowledge of civil and religious law.

For Varro - well versed in Euhemerus' theory - popular religious observance was based on a necessary fiction; what the people believed was not itself the truth, but their observance led them to as much higher truth as their limited capacity could deal with.Whereas in popular belief deities held power over mortal lives, the skeptic might say that mortal devotion had made gods of mortals, and these same gods were only sustained by devotion and cult.

He also insisted that the British give him exclusive command over all strategic air forces to facilitate Overlord, to the point of threatening to resign unless Churchill relented, as he did.Eisenhower then designed a bombing plan in France in advance of Overlord and argued with Churchill over the latter's concern with civilian casualties; de Gaulle interjected that the casualties were justified in shedding the yoke of the Germans, and Eisenhower prevailed.He also had to skillfully manage to retain the services of the often unruly George S. Patton, by severely reprimanding him when Patton earlier had slapped a subordinate, and then when Patton gave a speech in which he made improper comments about postwar policy.

Experts debate the causes, with some attributing it to speculative flow of money from housing and other investments into commodities, some to monetary policy, and some to the increasing feeling of raw materials scarcity in a fast-growing world, leading to long positions taken on those markets, such as Chinese increasing presence in Africa.An increase in oil prices tends to divert a larger share of consumer spending into gasoline, which creates downward pressure on economic growth in oil importing countries, as wealth flows to oil-producing states.

In 1439, while employed in Naples at the court of Alfonso V of Aragon (at the time engaged in a dispute with the Papal States) the humanist Lorenzo Valla used stylistic textual analysis, now called philology, to prove that the Donation of Constantine, which purported to confer temporal powers on the Pope of Rome, was an 8th-century forgery.For the next 70 years, however, neither Valla nor any of his contemporaries thought to apply the techniques of philology to other controversial manuscripts in this way.

Instead, after the fall of the Byzantine Empire to the Turks in 1453, which brought a flood of Greek Orthodox refugees to Italy, humanist scholars increasingly turned to the study of Neoplatonism and Hermeticism, hoping to bridge the differences between the Greek and Roman Churches, and even between Christianity itself and the non-Christian world.The refugees brought with them Greek manuscripts, not only of Plato and Aristotle, but also of the Christian Gospels, previously unavailable in the Latin West.

 	1	The ad fontes principle also had many applications.	The re-discovery of ancient manuscripts brought a more profound and accurate knowledge of ancient philosophical schools such as Epicureanism, and Neoplatonism, whose Pagan wisdom the humanists, like the Church fathers of old, tended, at least initially, to consider as deriving from divine revelation and thus adaptable to a life of Christian virtue.

 	1	The Cambrian is a major division of the geologic timescale that begins about 541.0 ± 1.0 Ma.	Cambrian continents are thought to have resulted from the breakup of a Neoproterozoic supercontinent called Pannotia.The waters of the Cambrian period appear to have been widespread and shallow.

 	0	The Cambrian is a major division of the geologic timescale that begins about 541.0 ± 1.0 Ma.	Laurentia, Baltica and Siberia remained independent continents following the break-up of the supercontinent of Pannotia.Gondwana started to drift toward the South Pole.Panthalassa covered most of the southern hemisphere, and minor oceans included the Proto-Tethys Ocean, Iapetus Ocean and Khanty Ocean.
 	1	The Ordovician Period started at a major extinction event called the Cambrian-Ordovician extinction events some time about 485.4 ± 1.9 Ma.	During the Ordovician the southern continents were collected into a single continent called Gondwana.Gondwana started the period in the equatorial latitudes and, as the period progressed, drifted toward the South Pole.
 	0	The Ordovician Period started at a major extinction event called the Cambrian-Ordovician extinction events some time about 485.4 ± 1.9 Ma.	Early in the Ordovician the continents Laurentia, Siberia and Baltica were still independent continents (since the break-up of the supercontinent Pannotia earlier), but Baltica began to move toward Laurentia later in the period, causing the Iapetus Ocean to shrink between them.
 	0	The Ordovician Period started at a major extinction event called the Cambrian-Ordovician extinction events some time about 485.4 ± 1.9 Ma.	Also, Avalonia broke free from Gondwana and began to head north toward Laurentia.The Rheic Ocean was formed as a result of this.By the end of the period, Gondwana had neared or approached the pole and was largely glaciated.
 	1	The most-commonly accepted theory is that these events were triggered by the onset of an ice age, in the Hirnantian faunal stage that ended the long, stable greenhouse conditions typical of the Ordovician.	The ice age was probably not as long-lasting as once thought; study of oxygen isotopes in fossil brachiopods shows that it was probably no longer than 0.5 to 1.5 million years.
 	0	The most-commonly accepted theory is that these events were triggered by the onset of an ice age, in the Hirnantian faunal stage that ended the long, stable greenhouse conditions typical of the Ordovician.	The event was preceded by a fall in atmospheric carbon dioxide (from 7000ppm to 4400ppm) which selectively affected the shallow seas where most organisms lived.
 	0	The most-commonly accepted theory is that these events were triggered by the onset of an ice age, in the Hirnantian faunal stage that ended the long, stable greenhouse conditions typical of the Ordovician.	As the southern supercontinent Gondwana drifted over the South Pole, ice caps formed on it.Evidence of these ice caps have been detected in Upper Ordovician rock strata of North Africa and then-adjacent northeastern South America, which were south-polar locations at the time.
 	1	The Silurian is a major division of the geologic timescale that started about 443.8 ± 1.5 Ma.	During the Silurian, Gondwana continued a slow southward drift to high southern latitudes, but there is evidence that the Silurian ice caps were less extensive than those of the late Ordovician glaciation.
 	0	The Silurian is a major division of the geologic timescale that started about 443.8 ± 1.5 Ma.	The melting of ice caps and glaciers contributed to a rise in sea levels, recognizable from the fact that Silurian sediments overlie eroded Ordovician sediments, forming an unconformity.Other cratons and continent fragments drifted together near the equator, starting the formation of a second supercontinent known as Euramerica.
 	0	The Silurian is a major division of the geologic timescale that started about 443.8 ± 1.5 Ma.	The vast ocean of Panthalassa covered most of the northern hemisphere.Other minor oceans include Proto-Tethys, Paleo-Tethys, Rheic Ocean, a seaway of Iapetus Ocean (now in between Avalonia and Laurentia), and newly formed Ural Ocean.
 	1	The Devonian spanned roughly from 419 to 359 Ma.The period was a time of great tectonic activity, as Laurasia and Gondwana drew closer together.	The continent Euramerica (or Laurussia) was created in the early Devonian by the collision of Laurentia and Baltica, which rotated into the natural dry zone along the Tropic of Capricorn.In these near-deserts, the Old Red Sandstone sedimentary beds formed, made red by the oxidized iron (hematite) characteristic of drought conditions.
 	0	The Devonian spanned roughly from 419 to 359 Ma.The period was a time of great tectonic activity, as Laurasia and Gondwana drew closer together.	Near the equator Pangaea began to consolidate from the plates containing North America and Europe, further raising the northern Appalachian Mountains and forming the Caledonian Mountains in Great Britain and Scandinavia.The southern continents remained tied together in the supercontinent of Gondwana.The remainder of modern Eurasia lay in the Northern Hemisphere.
 	0	The Devonian spanned roughly from 419 to 359 Ma.The period was a time of great tectonic activity, as Laurasia and Gondwana drew closer together.	"Sea levels were high worldwide, and much of the land lay submerged under shallow seas.The deep, enormous Panthalassa (the ""universal ocean"") covered the rest of the planet.Other minor oceans were Paleo-Tethys, Proto-Tethys, Rheic Ocean and Ural Ocean (which was closed during the collision with Siberia and Baltica)."
 	1	A global drop in sea level at the end of the Devonian reversed early in the Carboniferous; this created the widespread epicontinental seas and carbonate deposition of the Mississippian.	There was also a drop in south polar temperatures; southern Gondwana was glaciated throughout the period, though it is uncertain if the ice sheets were a holdover from the Devonian or not.
 	0	A global drop in sea level at the end of the Devonian reversed early in the Carboniferous; this created the widespread epicontinental seas and carbonate deposition of the Mississippian.	These conditions apparently had little effect in the deep tropics, where lush coal swamps flourished within 30 degrees of the northernmost glaciers.
 	0	A global drop in sea level at the end of the Devonian reversed early in the Carboniferous; this created the widespread epicontinental seas and carbonate deposition of the Mississippian.	A mid-Carboniferous drop in sea-level precipitated a major marine extinction, one that hit crinoids and ammonites especially hard.This sea-level drop and the associated unconformity in North America separate the Mississippian Period from the Pennsylvanian period.

 	0	The Carboniferous was a time of active mountain building, as the supercontinent Pangea came together.	This continental collision resulted in the Hercynian orogeny in Europe, and the Alleghenian orogeny in North America; it also extended the newly uplifted Appalachians southwestward as the Ouachita Mountains.In the same time frame, much of present eastern Eurasian plate welded itself to Europe along the line of the Ural mountains.
 	0	The Carboniferous was a time of active mountain building, as the supercontinent Pangea came together.	There were two major oceans in the Carboniferous the Panthalassa and Paleo-Tethys.Other minor oceans were shrinking and eventually closed the Rheic Ocean (closed by the assembly of South and North America), the small, shallow Ural Ocean (which was closed by the collision of Baltica, and Siberia continents, creating the Ural Mountains) and Proto-Tethys Ocean.
 	1	During the Permian all the Earth's major land masses, except portions of East Asia, were collected into a single supercontinent known as Pangaea.	Pangaea straddled the equator and extended toward the poles, with a corresponding effect on ocean currents in the single great ocean (Panthalassa, the universal sea), and the Paleo-Tethys Ocean, a large ocean that was between Asia and Gondwana.
 	0	During the Permian all the Earth's major land masses, except portions of East Asia, were collected into a single supercontinent known as Pangaea.	The Cimmeria continent rifted away from Gondwana and drifted north to Laurasia, causing the Paleo-Tethys to shrink.A new ocean was growing on its southern end, the Tethys Ocean, an ocean that would dominate much of the Mesozoic Era.

"Large continental landmasses create climates with extreme variations of heat and cold (""continental climate"") and monsoon conditions with highly seasonal rainfall patterns.Deserts seem to have been widespread on Pangaea."
 	1	"The remainder was the world-ocean known as Panthalassa (""all the sea"")."	All the deep-ocean sediments laid down during the Triassic have disappeared through subduction of oceanic plates; thus, very little is known of the Triassic open ocean.The supercontinent Pangaea was rifting during the Triassic—especially late in the period—but had not yet separated.
 	0	"The remainder was the world-ocean known as Panthalassa (""all the sea"")."	The first nonmarine sediments in the rift that marks the initial break-up of Pangea—which separated New Jersey from Morocco—are of Late Triassic age; in the U.S., these thick sediments comprise the Newark Supergroup.
 	0	"The remainder was the world-ocean known as Panthalassa (""all the sea"")."	Because of the limited shoreline of one super-continental mass, Triassic marine deposits are globally relatively rare; despite their prominence in Western Europe, where the Triassic was first studied.In North America, for example, marine deposits are limited to a few exposures in the west.Thus Triassic stratigraphy is mostly based on organisms living in lagoons and hypersaline environments, such as Estheria crustaceans and terrestrial vertebrates.
 	1	The Jurassic Period extends from about 201.3 ± 0.2 to 145.0 Ma.During the early Jurassic, the supercontinent Pangaea broke up into the northern supercontinent Laurasia and the southern supercontinent Gondwana; the Gulf of Mexico opened in the new rift between North America and what is now Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula.	The Jurassic North Atlantic Ocean was relatively narrow, while the South Atlantic did not open until the following Cretaceous Period, when Gondwana itself rifted apart.The Tethys Sea closed, and the Neotethys basin appeared.Climates were warm, with no evidence of glaciation.

As in the Triassic, there was apparently no land near either pole, and no extensive ice caps existed.The Jurassic geological record is good in western Europe, where extensive marine sequences indicate a time when much of the continent was submerged under shallow tropical seas; famous locales include the Jurassic Coast World Heritage Site and the renowned late Jurassic lagerstätten of Holzmaden and Solnhofen.

In contrast, the North American Jurassic record is the poorest of the Mesozoic, with few outcrops at the surface.Though the epicontinental Sundance Sea left marine deposits in parts of the northern plains of the United States and Canada during the late Jurassic, most exposed sediments from this period are continental, such as the alluvial deposits of the Morrison Formation.The first of several massive batholiths were emplaced in the northern Cordillera beginning in the mid-Jurassic, marking the Nevadan orogeny.Important Jurassic exposures are also found in Russia, India, South America, Japan, Australasia and the United Kingdom.
 	1	During the Cretaceous, the late Paleozoic-early Mesozoic supercontinent of Pangaea completed its breakup into present day continents, although their positions were substantially different at the time.	As the Atlantic Ocean widened, the convergent-margin orogenies that had begun during the Jurassic continued in the North American Cordillera, as the Nevadan orogeny was followed by the Sevier and Laramide orogenies.
 	0	During the Cretaceous, the late Paleozoic-early Mesozoic supercontinent of Pangaea completed its breakup into present day continents, although their positions were substantially different at the time.	Though Gondwana was still intact in the beginning of the Cretaceous, Gondwana itself broke up as South America, Antarctica and Australia rifted away from Africa (though India and Madagascar remained attached to each other); thus, the South Atlantic and Indian Oceans were newly formed.
 	0	During the Cretaceous, the late Paleozoic-early Mesozoic supercontinent of Pangaea completed its breakup into present day continents, although their positions were substantially different at the time.	Such active rifting lifted great undersea mountain chains along the welts, raising eustatic sea levels worldwide.
 	1	To the north of Africa the Tethys Sea continued to narrow.Broad shallow seas advanced across central North America (the Western Interior Seaway) and Europe, then receded late in the period, leaving thick marine deposits sandwiched between coal beds.	At the peak of the Cretaceous transgression, one-third of Earth's present land area was submerged.The Cretaceous is justly famous for its chalk; indeed, more chalk formed in the Cretaceous than in any other period in the Phanerozoic.

Mid-ocean ridge activity—or rather, the circulation of seawater through the enlarged ridges—enriched the oceans in calcium; this made the oceans more saturated, as well as increased the bioavailability of the element for calcareous nanoplankton.These widespread carbonates and other sedimentary deposits make the Cretaceous rock record especially fine.

South and North America remained separated by equatorial seas (they joined during the Neogene); the components of the former southern supercontinent Gondwana continued to split apart, with Africa, South America, Antarctica and Australia pulling away from each other.Africa was heading north toward Europe, slowly closing the Tethys Ocean, and India began its migration to Asia that would lead to a tectonic collision and the formation of the Himalayas.
 	1	During the Eocene (56 million years ago - 33.9 million years ago), the continents continued to drift toward their present positions.	At the beginning of the period, Australia and Antarctica remained connected, and warm equatorial currents mixed with colder Antarctic waters, distributing the heat around the world and keeping global temperatures high.
 	0	During the Eocene (56 million years ago - 33.9 million years ago), the continents continued to drift toward their present positions.	But when Australia split from the southern continent around 45 Ma, the warm equatorial currents were deflected away from Antarctica, and an isolated cold water channel developed between the two continents.The Antarctic region cooled down, and the ocean surrounding Antarctica began to freeze, sending cold water and ice floes north, reinforcing the cooling.

 	0	Among the vast varieties of microorganisms, relatively few cause disease in otherwise healthy individuals.	However a host's immune system can also cause damage to the host itself in an attempt to control the infection.Clinicians therefore classify infectious microorganisms or microbes according to the status of host defenses - either as primary pathogens or as opportunistic pathogens:
 	1	"One way of proving that a given disease is ""infectious"", is to satisfy Koch's postulates (first proposed by Robert Koch), which demands that the infectious agent be identified only in patients and not in healthy controls, and that patients who contract the agent also develop the disease.These postulates were first used in the discovery that Mycobacteria species cause tuberculosis."	Koch's postulates can not be applied ethically for many human diseases because they require experimental infection of a healthy individual with a pathogen produced as a pure culture.Often, even clearly infectious diseases do not meet the infectious criteria.

For example, Treponema pallidum, the causative spirochete of syphilis, cannot be cultured in vitro - however the organism can be cultured in rabbit testes.It is less clear that a pure culture comes from an animal source serving as host than it is when derived from microbes derived from plate culture.

Epidemiology is another important tool used to study disease in a population.For infectious diseases it helps to determine if a disease outbreak is sporadic (occasional occurrence), endemic (regular cases often occurring in a region), epidemic (an unusually high number of cases in a region), or pandemic (a global epidemic).

 	0	Infection begins when an organism successfully enters the body, grows and multiplies.This is referred to as colonization.	Individuals who have a suppressed immune system are particularly susceptible to opportunistic infections.Entrance to the host at host-pathogen interface, generally occurs through the mucosa in orifices like the oral cavity, nose, eyes, genitalia, anus, or the microbe can enter through open wounds.
 	0	Infection begins when an organism successfully enters the body, grows and multiplies.This is referred to as colonization.	While a few organisms can grow at the initial site of entry, many migrate and cause systemic infection in different organs.Some pathogens grow within the host cells (intracellular) whereas others grow freely in bodily fluids.
 	1	Wound colonization refers to nonreplicating microorganisms within the wound, while in infected wounds, replicating organisms exist and tissue is injured.All multicellular organisms are colonized to some degree by extrinsic organisms, and the vast majority of these exist in either a mutualistic or commensal relationship with the host.	An example of the former is the anaerobic bacteria species, which colonizes the mammalian colon, and an example of the latter is various species of staphylococcus that exist on human skin.Neither of these colonizations are considered infections.

 	0	Because it is normal to have bacterial colonization, it is difficult to know which chronic wounds are infected.	The review showed that the most useful finding is an increase in the level of pain [likelihood ratio (LR) range, 11-20] makes infection much more likely, but the absence of pain (negative likelihood ratio range, 0.64-0.88) does not rule out infection (summary LR 0.64-0.88).
 	1	Disease can arise if the host's protective immune mechanisms are compromised and the organism inflicts damage on the host.	Microorganisms can cause tissue damage by releasing a variety of toxins or destructive enzymes.For example, Clostridium tetani releases a toxin that paralyzes muscles, and staphylococcus releases toxins that produce shock and sepsis.

 	1	Microbiological culture is a principal tool used to diagnose infectious disease.In a microbial culture, a growth medium is provided for a specific agent.A sample taken from potentially diseased tissue or fluid is then tested for the presence of an infectious agent able to grow within that medium.	"Most pathogenic bacteria are easily grown on nutrient agar, a form of solid medium that supplies carbohydrates and proteins necessary for growth of a bacterium, along with copious amounts of water.A single bacterium will grow into a visible mound on the surface of the plate called a colony, which may be separated from other colonies or melded together into a ""lawn"".The size, color, shape and form of a colony is characteristic of the bacterial species, its specific genetic makeup (its strain), and the environment that supports its growth."

Another useful identification method is Xenodiagnosis, or the use of a vector to support the growth of an infectious agent.Chagas disease is the most significant example, because it is difficult to directly demonstrate the presence of the causative agent, Trypanosoma cruzi in a patient, which therefore makes it difficult to definitively make a diagnosis.

 	1	Other microscopic procedures may also aid in identifying infectious agents.Almost all cells readily stain with a number of basic dyes due to the electrostatic attraction between negatively charged cellular molecules and the positive charge on the dye.	A cell is normally transparent under a microscope, and using a stain increases the contrast of a cell with its background.Staining a cell with a dye such as Giemsa stain or crystal violet allows a microscopist to describe its size, shape, internal and external components and its associations with other cells.

 	1	There is usually an indication for a specific identification of an infectious agent only when such identification can aid in the treatment or prevention of the disease, or to advance knowledge of the course of an illness prior to the development of effective therapeutic or preventative measures.For example, in the early 1980s, prior to the appearance of AZT for the treatment of AIDS, the course of the disease was closely followed by monitoring the composition of patient blood samples, even though the outcome would not offer the patient any further treatment options.	In part, these studies on the appearance of HIV in specific communities permitted the advancement of hypotheses as to the route of transmission of the virus.By understanding how the disease was transmitted, resources could be targeted to the communities at greatest risk in campaigns aimed at reducing the number of new infections.

Also, this virus must spread through skin lesions or permeable membranes such as the eye.Thus, the initial stage of Ebola is not very contagious since its victims experience only internal hemorrhaging.As a result of the above features, the spread of Ebola is very rapid and usually stays within a relatively confined geographical area.

In contrast, the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) kills its victims very slowly by attacking their immune system.As a result, many of its victims transmit the virus to other individuals before even realizing that they are carrying the disease.Also, the relatively low virulence allows its victims to travel long distances, increasing the likelihood of an epidemic.
 	1	Another effective way to decrease the transmission rate of infectious diseases is to recognize the effects of small-world networks.	In epidemics, there are often extensive interactions within hubs or groups of infected individuals and other interactions within discrete hubs of susceptible individuals.Despite the low interaction between discrete hubs, the disease can jump to and spread in a susceptible hub via a single or few interactions with an infected hub.

 	1	A number of studies have reported associations between pathogen load in an area and human behavior.Higher pathogen load is associated with decreased size of ethnic and religious groups in an area.	This may be due high pathogen load favoring avoidance of other groups, which may reduce pathogen transmission, or a high pathogen load preventing the creation of large settlements and armies that enforce a common culture.Higher pathogen load is also associated with more restricted sexual behavior, which may reduce pathogen transmission.It also associated with higher preferences for health and attractiveness in mates.

 	0	A number of studies have reported associations between pathogen load in an area and human behavior.Higher pathogen load is associated with decreased size of ethnic and religious groups in an area.	Higher pathogen load is also associated with more collectivism and less individualism, which may limit contacts with outside groups and infections.There are alternative explanations for at least some of the associations although some of these explanations may in turn ultimately be due to pathogen load.Thus, polygny may also be due to a lower male:female ratio in these areas but this may ultimately be due to male infants having increased mortality from infectious diseases.Another example is that poor socioeconomic factors may ultimately in part be due to high pathogen load preventing economic development.

 	1	There is a very active tradition of hunting of small to medium-sized wild game in Trinidad and Tobago.Hunting is carried out with firearms, and aided by the use of hounds, with the illegal use of trap guns, trap cages and snare nets.With approximately 12,000 sport hunters applying for hunting licences in recent years (in a very small country of about the size of the state of Delaware at about 5128 square kilometers and 1.3 million inhabitants), there is some concern that the practice might not be sustainable.	In addition there are at present no bag limits and the open season is comparatively very long (5 months - October to February inclusive).As such hunting pressure from legal hunters is very high.Added to that, there is a thriving and very lucrative black market for poached wild game (sold and enthusiastically purchased as expensive luxury delicacies) and the numbers of commercial poachers in operation is unknown but presumed to be fairly high.As a result, the populations of the five major mammalian game species (red-rumped agouti, lowland paca, nine-banded armadillo, collared peccary, and red brocket deer) are thought to be quite low (although scientifically conducted population studies are only just recently being conducted as of 2013).

 	0	Myocardial infarction (MI) or acute myocardial infarction (AMI), commonly known as a heart attack, occurs when blood flow stops to a part of the heart causing damage to the heart muscle.The most common symptom is chest pain or discomfort which may travel into the shoulder, arm, back, neck, or jaw.	Among those over 75 years old, about 5% have had an MI with little or no history of symptoms.An MI may cause heart failure, an irregular heartbeat, or cardiac arrest.
 	1	Most MIs occur due to coronary artery disease.	Risk factors include high blood pressure, smoking, diabetes, lack of exercise, obesity, high blood cholesterol, poor diet, and excessive alcohol intake, among others.The mechanism of an MI often involves the complete blockage of a coronary artery caused by a rupture of an atherosclerotic plaque.
 	0	Most MIs occur due to coronary artery disease.	MIs are less commonly caused by coronary artery spasms, which may be due to cocaine, significant emotional stress, and extreme cold, among others.
 	0	Most MIs occur due to coronary artery disease.	A number of tests are useful to help with diagnosis, including electrocardiograms (ECGs), blood tests, and coronary angiography.An ECG may confirm an ST elevation MI if ST elevation is present.Commonly used blood tests include troponin and less often creatine kinase MB.
 	1	Aspirin is an appropriate immediate treatment for a suspected MI.	Nitroglycerin or opioids may be used to help with chest pain; however, they do not improve overall outcomes.Supplemental oxygen should be used in those with low oxygen levels or shortness of breath.
 	0	Aspirin is an appropriate immediate treatment for a suspected MI.	In ST elevation MIs treatments which attempt to restore blood flow to the heart are typically recommended and include angioplasty, where the arteries are pushed open, or thrombolysis, where the blockage is removed using medications.
 	0	Aspirin is an appropriate immediate treatment for a suspected MI.	People who have a non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) are often managed with the blood thinner heparin, with the additional use angioplasty in those at high risk.In people with blockages of multiple coronary arteries and diabetes, bypass surgery (CABG) may be recommended rather than angioplasty.After an MI, lifestyle modifications, along with long term treatment with aspirin, beta blockers, and statins, are typically recommended.
 	1	The onset of symptoms in myocardial infarction (MI) is usually gradual, over several minutes, and rarely instantaneous.	Chest pain is the most common symptom of acute MI and is often described as a sensation of tightness, pressure, or squeezing.
 	0	The onset of symptoms in myocardial infarction (MI) is usually gradual, over several minutes, and rarely instantaneous.	Chest pain due to ischemia (a lack of blood and hence oxygen supply) of the heart muscle is termed angina pectoris.
 	0	The onset of symptoms in myocardial infarction (MI) is usually gradual, over several minutes, and rarely instantaneous.	Pain radiates most often to the left arm, but may also radiate to the lower jaw, neck, right arm, back, and upper abdomen, where it may mimic heartburn.Levine's sign, in which a person localizes the chest pain by clenching their fists over their sternum, has classically been thought to be predictive of cardiac chest pain, although a prospective observational study showed it had a poor positive predictive value.
 	1	Shortness of breath occurs when the damage to the heart limits the output of the left ventricle, causing left ventricular failure and consequent pulmonary edema.	Other symptoms include diaphoresis (an excessive form of sweating), weakness, light-headedness, nausea, vomiting, and palpitations.
 	0	Shortness of breath occurs when the damage to the heart limits the output of the left ventricle, causing left ventricular failure and consequent pulmonary edema.	These symptoms are likely induced by a massive surge of catecholamines from the sympathetic nervous system, which occurs in response to pain and the blood flow abnormalities that result from dysfunction of the heart muscle.
 	0	Shortness of breath occurs when the damage to the heart limits the output of the left ventricle, causing left ventricular failure and consequent pulmonary edema.	Loss of consciousness (due to inadequate blood flow to the brain and cardiogenic shock) and sudden death (frequently due to the development of ventricular fibrillation) can occur in MIs.

 	0	Atypical symptoms are more frequently reported by women, the elderly, and those with diabetes when compared to their male and younger counterparts.	The most common symptoms of MI in women include dyspnea, weakness, and fatigue.Fatigue, sleep disturbances, and dyspnea have been reported as frequently occurring symptoms that may manifest as long as one month before the actual clinically manifested ischemic event.
 	0	Atypical symptoms are more frequently reported by women, the elderly, and those with diabetes when compared to their male and younger counterparts.	In women, chest pain may be less predictive of coronary ischemia than in men.Women may also experience back or jaw pain during an episode.
 	1	At least one quarter of all MIs are silent, without chest pain or other symptoms.	These cases can be discovered later on electrocardiograms, using blood enzyme tests, or at autopsy without a prior history of related complaints.
 	0	At least one quarter of all MIs are silent, without chest pain or other symptoms.	Estimates of the prevalence of silent MIs vary between 22 and 64%.
 	0	At least one quarter of all MIs are silent, without chest pain or other symptoms.	A silent course is more common in the elderly, in people with diabetes mellitus and after heart transplantation, probably because the donor heart is not fully innervated by the nervous system of the recipient.In people with diabetes, differences in pain threshold, autonomic neuropathy, and psychological factors have been cited as possible explanations for the lack of symptoms.
 	1	Tobacco smoking (including secondhand smoke) and short-term exposure to air pollution such as carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide, and sulfur dioxide (but not ozone) have been associated with MI.	Other factors that increase the risk of MI and are associated with worse outcomes after an MI include lack of physical activity and psychosocial factors including low socioeconomic status, social isolation, and negative emotions.

Plaques can become unstable, rupture, and additionally promote the formation of a blood clot that occludes the artery; this can occur in minutes.When a severe enough plaque rupture occurs in the coronary arteries, it leads to MI (necrosis of downstream myocardium).It is estimated that one billion cardiac cells are lost in a typical MI.
 	1	If impaired blood flow to the heart lasts long enough, it triggers a process called the ischemic cascade; the heart cells in the territory of the occluded coronary artery die (chiefly through necrosis) and do not grow back.	A collagen scar forms in their place.
 	0	If impaired blood flow to the heart lasts long enough, it triggers a process called the ischemic cascade; the heart cells in the territory of the occluded coronary artery die (chiefly through necrosis) and do not grow back.

As a result, the person's heart will be permanently damaged.This myocardial scarring also puts the person at risk for potentially life-threatening abnormal heart rhythms (arrhythmias), and may result in the formation of a ventricular aneurysm that can rupture with catastrophic consequences.
 	1	Injured heart tissue conducts electrical impulses more slowly than normal heart tissue.	The difference in conduction velocity between injured and uninjured tissue can trigger re-entry or a feedback loop that is believed to be the cause of many lethal arrhythmias.
 	0	Injured heart tissue conducts electrical impulses more slowly than normal heart tissue.	The most serious of these arrhythmias is ventricular fibrillation (V-Fib/VF), an extremely fast and chaotic heart rhythm that is the leading cause of sudden cardiac death.Another life-threatening arrhythmia is ventricular tachycardia (V-tach/VT), which can cause sudden cardiac death.
 	0	Injured heart tissue conducts electrical impulses more slowly than normal heart tissue.	However, VT usually results in rapid heart rates that prevent the heart from pumping blood effectively.Cardiac output and blood pressure may fall to dangerous levels, which can lead to further coronary ischemia and extension of the infarct.

 	0	Myocardial infarction in the setting of plaque results from underlying atherosclerosis.	Moreover, some drugs for MI might also reduce CRP levels.The use of high-sensitivity CRP assays as a means of screening the general population is advised against, but it may be used optionally at the physician's discretion in those who already present with other risk factors or known coronary artery disease.Whether CRP plays a direct role in atherosclerosis remains uncertain.
 	1	For a person to qualify as having a STEMI, in addition to reported angina, the ECG must show new ST elevation in two or more adjacent ECG leads.	This must be greater than 2 mm (0.2 mV) for males and greater than 1.5 mm (0.15 mV) in females if in leads V2 and V3 or greater than 1 mm (0.1 mV) if it is in other ECG leads.

 	0	For a person to qualify as having a STEMI, in addition to reported angina, the ECG must show new ST elevation in two or more adjacent ECG leads.	In early STEMIs there may just be peaked T waves with ST elevation developing later.
 	1	In stable patients whose symptoms have resolved by the time of evaluation, technetium (99mTc) sestamibi (i.e.	"a ""MIBI scan"") or thallium-201 chloride can be used in nuclear medicine to visualize areas of reduced blood flow in conjunction with physiological or pharmacological stress."

 	1	There is some controversy surrounding the effect of dietary fat on the development of cardiovascular disease.	People are often advised to keep a diet where less than 30% of the energy intake derives from fat, a diet that contains less than 7% of the energy intake in the form of saturated fat, and a diet that contains less than 300 mg/day of cholesterol.
 	0	There is some controversy surrounding the effect of dietary fat on the development of cardiovascular disease.	Replacing saturated with mono- polyunsaturated fat is also recommended, as the consumption of polyunsaturated fat instead of saturated fat may decrease coronary heart disease.

 	1	Thrombolysis involves the administration of medication that activates the enzymes that normally destroy blood clots.	Thrombolysis agents include streptokinase, reteplase, alteplase, and tenecteplase.If no contraindications are present (such as a high risk of bleeding), thrombolysis can be given in the pre-hospital or in-hospital setting.
 	0	Thrombolysis involves the administration of medication that activates the enzymes that normally destroy blood clots.	When given to people suspected of having a STEMI within 6 hours of the onset of symptoms, thrombolytic drugs save the life of 1 in 43 who received them.
 	0	Thrombolysis involves the administration of medication that activates the enzymes that normally destroy blood clots.	The risks were major bleeding (1 in 143) and brain bleeding (1 in 250).It is unclear whether pre-hospital thrombolysis reduces death in people with STEMI compared to in-hospital thrombolysis.Pre-hospital thrombolysis reduces time to thrombolytic treatment, based on studies conducted in higher income countries.
 	1	People with an acute coronary syndrome where no ST elevation is demonstrated (non-ST elevation ACS or NSTEACS) are treated with aspirin.	Clopidogrel is added in many cases, particularly if the risk of cardiovascular events is felt to be high and early PCI is being considered.
 	0	People with an acute coronary syndrome where no ST elevation is demonstrated (non-ST elevation ACS or NSTEACS) are treated with aspirin.	Depending on whether early PCI is planned, a factor Xa inhibitor or a potentiator of antithrombin (fondaparinux or low molecular weight heparin respectively) may be added.
 	0	People with an acute coronary syndrome where no ST elevation is demonstrated (non-ST elevation ACS or NSTEACS) are treated with aspirin.	In very high-risk scenarios, inhibitors of the platelet glycoprotein αIIbβ3a receptor such as eptifibatide or tirofiban may be used.

In addition, in some jurisdictions, heart attacks suffered by persons in particular occupations such as police officers may be classified as line-of-duty injuries by statute or policy.In some countries or states, a person having suffered from an MI may be prevented from participating in activity that puts other people's lives at risk, for example driving a car or flying an airplane.
 	1	Before the 20th century, the term matter included ordinary matter composed of atoms and excluded other energy phenomena such as light or sound.	This concept of matter may be generalized from atoms to include any objects having mass even when at rest, but this is ill-defined because an object's mass can arise from its (possibly massless) constituents' motion and interaction energies.

For much of the history of the natural sciences people have contemplated the exact nature of matter.The idea that matter was built of discrete building blocks, the so-called particulate theory of matter, was first put forward by the Greek philosophers Leucippus (~490 BC) and Democritus (~470–380 BC).
 	1	Matter should not be confused with mass, as the two are not quite the same in modern physics.	For example, mass is a conserved quantity, which means that its value is unchanging through time, within closed systems.
 	0	Matter should not be confused with mass, as the two are not quite the same in modern physics.	However, matter is not conserved in such systems, although this is not obvious in ordinary conditions on Earth, where matter is approximately conserved.Still, special relativity shows that matter may disappear by conversion into energy, even inside closed systems, and it can also be created from energy, within such systems.
 	0	Matter should not be confused with mass, as the two are not quite the same in modern physics.	However, because mass (like energy) can neither be created nor destroyed, the quantity of mass and the quantity of energy remain the same during a transformation of matter (which represents a certain amount of energy) into non-material (i.e., non-matter) energy.This is also true in the reverse transformation of energy into matter.
 	1	Different fields of science use the term matter in different, and sometimes incompatible, ways.	Some of these ways are based on loose historical meanings, from a time when there was no reason to distinguish mass and matter.

 	1	In the context of relativity, mass is not an additive quantity, in the sense that one can add the rest masses of particles in a system to get the total rest mass of the system.

 	1	The reason for this is that in this definition, electromagnetic radiation (such as light) as well as the energy of electromagnetic fields contributes to the mass of systems, and therefore appears to add matter to them.	For example, light radiation (or thermal radiation) trapped inside a box would contribute to the mass of the box, as would any kind of energy inside the box, including the kinetic energy of particles held by the box.

Thus, a photon with no mass may (confusingly) still add mass to a system in which it is trapped.The same is true of the kinetic energy of particles, which by definition is not part of their rest mass, but which does add rest mass to systems in which these particles reside (an example is the mass added by the motion of gas molecules of a bottle of gas, or by the thermal energy of any hot object).

 	1	The quark–lepton definition of ordinary matter, however, identifies not only the elementary building blocks of matter, but also includes composites made from the constituents (atoms and molecules, for example).	Such composites contain an interaction energy that holds the constituents together, and may constitute the bulk of the mass of the composite.As an example, to a great extent, the mass of an atom is simply the sum of the masses of its constituent protons, neutrons and electrons.
 	0	The quark–lepton definition of ordinary matter, however, identifies not only the elementary building blocks of matter, but also includes composites made from the constituents (atoms and molecules, for example).

 	0	The quark–lepton definition of ordinary matter, however, identifies not only the elementary building blocks of matter, but also includes composites made from the constituents (atoms and molecules, for example).	"In other words, most of what composes the ""mass"" of ordinary matter is due to the binding energy of quarks within protons and neutrons.For example, the sum of the mass of the three quarks in a nucleon is approximately 7001125000000000000♠12.5 MeV/c2, which is low compared to the mass of a nucleon (approximately 7002938000000000000♠938 MeV/c2).The bottom line is that most of the mass of everyday objects comes from the interaction energy of its elementary components."

These phases include the three familiar ones (solids, liquids, and gases), as well as more exotic states of matter (such as plasmas, superfluids, supersolids, Bose–Einstein condensates, ...).A fluid may be a liquid, gas or plasma.

 	1	These quarks and leptons interact through four fundamental forces: gravity, electromagnetism, weak interactions, and strong interactions.	The Standard Model of particle physics is currently the best explanation for all of physics, but despite decades of efforts, gravity cannot yet be accounted for at the quantum level; it is only described by classical physics (see quantum gravity and graviton).Interactions between quarks and leptons are the result of an exchange of force-carrying particles (such as photons) between quarks and leptons.

 	0	These quarks and leptons interact through four fundamental forces: gravity, electromagnetism, weak interactions, and strong interactions.	As one consequence, mass and energy (which cannot be created or destroyed) cannot always be related to matter (which can be created out of non-matter particles such as photons, or even out of pure energy, such as kinetic energy).Force carriers are usually not considered matter: the carriers of the electric force (photons) possess energy (see Planck relation) and the carriers of the weak force (W and Z bosons) are massive, but neither are considered matter either.However, while these particles are not considered matter, they do contribute to the total mass of atoms, subatomic particles, and all systems that contain them.

In discussions of matter and antimatter, normal matter has been referred to by Alfvén as koinomatter (Gk.
