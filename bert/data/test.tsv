There are some cultures that can be referred to as “people who live outside of time.”	"The Amondawa tribe, living in Brazil, does not have a concept of time that can be measured or counted."
We all know that tempers are one of the first things lost in many arguments.	"It’s easy to say one should keep cool, but how do you do it?"
Some consumers buy skin creams and baby products for their soothing effect on the skin.	"In fact, consumers who have a high need for touch tend to like products that provide this opportunity."
" If you were at a zoo, then you might say you are ‘near’ an animal if you could reach out and touch it through the bars of its cage."	Here the word ‘near’ means an arm’s length away.
"If you were telling someone how to get to your local shop, you might call it ‘near’ if it was a five­minute walk away."	Now the word ‘near’ means much longer than an arm’s length away.
"It might be easier if you describe patterns of stars. You could say something like, “See that big triangle of bright stars there?” Or, “Do you see those five stars that look like a big letter W?”"	"When you do that, you’re doing exactly what we all do when we look at the stars. We look for patterns, not just so that we can point something out to someone else, but also because that’s what we humans have always done."
"In one study, researchers looked at how people respond to life challenges including getting a job, taking an exam, or undergoing surgery."	"For each of these conditions, the researchers also measured how much these participants fantasized about positive outcomes and how much they actually expected a positive outcome."
But what this means is that the evidence is based on just the personal opinions from a small sample with no objective measurement of their skin’s condition.	"Furthermore, we are not told how these women were selected."
"The surprising result of a nationwide inquiry among America’s most famous mathematicians, including Einstein, to find out their working methods, was that thinking “plays only a subordinate part in the brief, decisive phase of the creative act itself.”"	"So I would say that the simple reason why the majority of scientists are not creative is not because they don’t know how to think, but because they don’t know how to stop thinking."
"For example, tree rings usually grow wider in warm, wet years and are thinner in years when it is cold and dry."	"If the tree has experienced stressful conditions, such as a drought, the tree might hardly grow at all during that time."
"Training and conditioning for baseball focuses on developing strength, power, speed, quickness and flexibility."	"Before the 1980s, strength training was not an important part of conditioning for a baseball player."
"Before the 1980s, strength training was not an important part of conditioning for a baseball player."	"People viewed baseball as a game of skill and technique rather than strength, and most managers and coaches saw strength training as something for bodybuilders, not baseball players."
"People viewed baseball as a game of skill and technique rather than strength, and most managers and coaches saw strength training as something for bodybuilders, not baseball players."	They feared that weight lifting and building large muscles would cause players to lose flexibility and interfere with quickness and proper technique.
Making a small request that people will accept will naturally increase the chances of their accepting a bigger request afterwards. 	"For instance, a salesperson might request you to sign a petition to prevent cruelty against animals. This is a very small request, and most people will do what the salesperson asks."
"For instance, a salesperson might request you to sign a petition to prevent cruelty against animals. This is a very small request, and most people will do what the salesperson asks."	"After this, the salesperson asks you if you are interested in buying any cruelty-free cosmetics from their store. Given the fact that most people agree to the prior request to sign the petition, they will be more likely to purchase the cosmetics."
Many studies have shown that people’s health and subjective well-being are affected by ethnic relations. Members of minority groups in general have poorer health outcomes than the majority group.	"But that difference remains even when obvious factors, such as social class and access to medical services are controlled for. This suggests that dominance relations have their own effect on people’s health. How could that be the case?"
"But that difference remains even when obvious factors, such as social class and access to medical services are controlled for. This suggests that dominance relations have their own effect on people’s health. How could that be the case?"	"One possible answer is stress. From multiple physiological studies, we know that encounters with members of other ethnic-racial categories, even in the relatively safe environment of laboratories, trigger stress responses."
"Minority individuals have many encounters with majority individuals, each of which may trigger such responses. "	"However minimal these effects may be, their frequency may increase total stress, which would account for part of the health disadvantage of minority individuals. "
The stage director must gain the audience’s attention and direct their eyes to a particular spot or actor. 	"This can be done through lighting, costumes, scenery, voice, and movements."
Life really doesn’t give many people a second chance to make a good first impression.	It has been determined that it takes only a few seconds for anyone to assess another individual.
Motivation not only drives the final behaviors that bring a goal closer but also creates willingness to expend time and energy on preparatory behaviors.	"Thus, someone motivated to buy a new smartphone may earn extra money for it, drive through a storm to reach the store, and then wait in line to buy it."
They are aware that no two people act in exactly the same way and so do not feel threatened if they see one employee going about a task differently than another.	"Instead, they focus on the end result."
"Interpersonal messages combine content and relationship dimensions. That is, they refer to the real world, to something external to both speaker and listener; at the same time they also refer to the relationship between parties."	"For example, a supervisor may say to a trainee, “See me after the meeting.” This simple message has a content message that tells the trainee to see the supervisor after the meeting."
It also contains a relationship message that says something about the connection between the supervisor and the trainee. Even the use of the simple command shows there is a status difference that allows the supervisor to command the trainee.	You can appreciate this most clearly if you visualize the same command being made by the trainee to the supervisor.
The scientific study of the physical characteristics of colors can be traced back to Isaac Newton.	"One day, he spotted a set of prisms at a big county fair. He took them home and began to experiment with them. In a darkened room he allowed a thin ray of sunlight to fall on a triangular glass prism."
"As soon as the white ray hit the prism, it separated into the familiar colors of the rainbow. This finding was not new, as humans had observed the rainbow since the beginning of time"	It was only when Newton placed a second prism in the path of the spectrum that he found something new.
"But even if they feature in stories created today, they have always been the products of the human imagination and never existed."	"One possible answer is stress. From multiple physiological studies, we know that encounters with members of other ethnic-racial categories, even in the relatively safe environment of laboratories, trigger stress responses."
"When I was very young, I had a difficulty telling the difference between dinosaurs and dragons."	But there is a significant difference between them.
"However, some wild mushrooms are dangerous, leading people to lose their lives due to mushroom poisoning."	"To be safe, a person must be able to identify edible mushrooms before eating any wild one."
"This is because people sometimes confuse the poisonous and edible varieties, or they eat mushrooms without making a positive identification of the variety."	The stage director must gain the audience’s attention and direct their eyes to a particular spot or actor.
