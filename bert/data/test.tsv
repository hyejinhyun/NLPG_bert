 	 	Gold is a relatively soft metal, so much so that rings are very rarely made from pure gold metal because they get scratched quickly.	The answer is that they sit inside the gold crystal structure, taking the place of a gold atom, and it is this atom substitution inside the crystal lattice of the gold that makes it stronger.
 	 	Gold is a relatively soft metal, so much so that rings are very rarely made from pure gold metal because they get scratched quickly.	But if you alloy gold, by adding a small percentage of other metals such as silver or copper, you not only change the color of the gold―silver making the gold whiter, and copper making the gold redder―you make the gold harder, much harder.
 	 	Gold is a relatively soft metal, so much so that rings are very rarely made from pure gold metal because they get scratched quickly.	This changing of the properties of metals by very small additions of other ingredients is what makes the study of metals so fascinating. In the case of gold alloys, you might wonder where the silver atoms go.
